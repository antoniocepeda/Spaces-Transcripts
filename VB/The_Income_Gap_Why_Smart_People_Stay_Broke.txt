♪♪
You.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello everybody, thanks for joining in.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll start in about a minute or two.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're just waiting for a couple of people to join in as well as my co-host.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll begin in exactly a minute from now.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right then, thanks for joining in.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have sent in a DM for a couple of people for them to join in.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's hope they join, but thank you for joining in, people, and thank you for tuning in for the people who are listening through the recording, because this is a recorded space, so there will be people who will listen to the recording as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to say a quick hi to Kyle and DukeFX.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think this is the first time you guys are joining my space.
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate you all.
[SPEAKER_05]: so today what is the topic the topic is the income gap as you can see and we are going to be discussing why smart people stay broke guys by the way this is an open mic feel free to jump on the stage and
[SPEAKER_05]: and yeah feel free to jump on the stage and give your points and perspective on this on the matter if you feel that you can contribute otherwise definitely you can ask me a question through the comment section in the purple pill below would also like to mention that you can go through the thread which is posted on the jumbotron above for you to read exactly what we're going to be talking about so that's a that's a thing that you guys can do but let's begin
[SPEAKER_05]: So today is actually day 69 of me building in public.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the topic that I chose is why smart people stay broke.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know that sounds harsh, but it's definitely true.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is absolutely real.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are people who've read, who read about 10 plus books a year in their 20s, people who go through 100 plus YouTube videos, read podcasts,
[SPEAKER_05]: You've taken notes, you probably have insights most people don't have.
[SPEAKER_05]: But when someone asks you, what do you do for a living apart from your 9-5 job?
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys, you people freeze.
[SPEAKER_05]: I am not a stranger to this.
[SPEAKER_05]: A couple of years ago, I would have, it was the same for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I know exactly how that feels.
[SPEAKER_05]: The reason people freeze when someone asks exactly what do you do is because they can't package what they know into something someone would actually pay for.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to say a quick hi to the people who are joining in by the way.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for joining in, my friends.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's the first time you're joining.
[SPEAKER_05]: Please feel free to go through the thread posted on the Jumbotron above for information about what we're talking about, as well as any questions that arise.
[SPEAKER_05]: My friends, please feel free to
[SPEAKER_05]: Ask it in the purple pill below.
[SPEAKER_05]: I will be responding to it actively, number one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Number two is you can feel free to join the speaker section as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: And number three, guys, please like and reshare the space.
[SPEAKER_05]: It does help a lot in promoting the space and getting some interesting people into the space as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: But let's continue.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are talking about why most people stay broke and this does sound harsh but it is true.
[SPEAKER_05]: People watch hundreds of YouTube videos, hundreds of podcasts, read tens and fifties of books but when people ask them what they do they actually freeze.
[SPEAKER_05]: They freeze because they don't know exactly
[SPEAKER_05]: how to package what they know into something someone would pay for.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the problem that we want to solve here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to say a quick hi to Jodell, who's joined in.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for joining in, Jodell.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been a while.
[SPEAKER_05]: Please feel free to jump in the speaker section if you feel like you can contribute to this or just hang out there in the listener section.
[SPEAKER_05]: But wonderful to have you here.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yes, so today, in today's space, we are going to be breaking down
[SPEAKER_05]: Number one, the three gaps that keep smart people broke.
[SPEAKER_05]: Number two, why most creators never cross them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And number three, the exact system to bridge the gap.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just bringing Judel up here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, and I'm doing this live, guys, because I'm running this exact system with current two clients that I have right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is real validation, this is real results.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, this is number one helpful for myself, because it reconfirms what I am currently doing with my clients, as well as I think it'll help anybody in the current journey as I am.
[SPEAKER_05]: But before we dive deep, I want to say a quick hello to Jodell,
[SPEAKER_05]: Jodel, it's wonderful to have you here.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's also been a while.
[SPEAKER_05]: How are things going at your end?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, hi, Vivi.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really happy to catch your space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm on East Coast time right now, so it's like three hours different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it makes all the difference in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not 3 a.m. or 4 a.m. in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I'm really happy to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love this topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually have some to share about it as well, but I'll wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to hear what you have to say first.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, yeah, excited to spend my morning with you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Jodell.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for joining in.
[SPEAKER_05]: So East Coast, what time would it actually be right now if you were at home, if I may ask?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so if I was at home, it would be 4 a.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right now it's 7 a.m. All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty early as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: But thanks for joining in, and nevertheless, Gerald.
[SPEAKER_05]: But at this time, it's like 5.30 for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty late.
[SPEAKER_05]: I usually host maybe one hour earlier, 5.30 p.m.
[SPEAKER_05]: I usually host one hour earlier.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just got slightly delayed today.
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess I won't be seeing you much in my future spaces, perhaps.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's wonderful to have you here while I have you here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now that we've
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's cut to the go back to the topic.
[SPEAKER_05]: The topic that is at hand is how do we solve the income gap?
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what we are solving today is we're going to break down three things.
[SPEAKER_05]: Number one is the three gaps that keep you broke.
[SPEAKER_05]: Number two is why most creators never cross them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Number three is the exact system to bridge the gap.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's talk about the problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: The problem here is
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would like for people to contribute here as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, most people are shy to come on the stage, but you can definitely contribute to the Purple Pill guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: Drop in comments over there if you if you find something interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: Number one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Number two is if you can answer this question, how many videos YouTube videos have you guys watched since the last month?
[SPEAKER_05]: How many books have you read in this year?
[SPEAKER_05]: Entire year.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is November already.
[SPEAKER_05]: How many?
[SPEAKER_05]: Podcasts, have you watched?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the real question.
[SPEAKER_05]: There is no information gap.
[SPEAKER_05]: People have a lot of information, especially in today's day and age.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's a quick question, guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: How many books have you read?
[SPEAKER_05]: How many videos have you watched?
[SPEAKER_05]: How many podcasts have you watched in this entire year?
[SPEAKER_05]: And now, the next question, how many of those books or videos or podcasts have made you money?
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the gap that I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would like to say a quick hello to the engineer as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Engineer, my friend, it's wonderful to have you in the space as well as it's great to kind of see your success on YouTube as well as your live spaces here.
[SPEAKER_05]: So feel free to jump on the speaker section whenever you if you feel the need to.
[SPEAKER_05]: But nice to have you here, my friend.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been a while.
[SPEAKER_05]: Going back to the topic at hand.
[SPEAKER_05]: Guys, how many books have you read?
[SPEAKER_05]: How many videos have you watched?
[SPEAKER_05]: How many podcasts have you watched this past year?
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, the next question is how many of those books, videos or podcasts have made you money?
[SPEAKER_05]: You've probably spent hundreds of hours watching this entire year.
[SPEAKER_05]: And one more statistic for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: On a daily basis, we consume about 72 GB of information per day.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we consume a lot, but we don't create.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the gap I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're consuming, you're learning, you're growing, but you're not earning most people at least one to two levels below me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, if you talk about me six months ago, eight months ago on X, I had no idea how to do this.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm literally talking to my past self over here.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're consuming, you're learning, but you're not growing.
[SPEAKER_05]: you're growing but you're not earning and it's not because you don't know enough it's because you haven't extracted what you know into something sellable and that's the income gap the income gap what I mean by it is it's the space between knowing and earning right between having knowledge and
[SPEAKER_05]: and making money from your knowledge.
[SPEAKER_05]: Most creators think the problem is information.
[SPEAKER_05]: Guys, information is free of cost.
[SPEAKER_05]: Google, YouTube in today's age that everybody has access to the same information that you have.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's not the problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: Most creators think the problem is information.
[SPEAKER_05]: I need to read one more book.
[SPEAKER_05]: I need to take one more course.
[SPEAKER_05]: I need to watch one more video or learn one more framework.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's wrong.
[SPEAKER_05]: You already have enough information.
[SPEAKER_05]: What you're missing out on is extraction.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're collecting highlights from the books that you're reading, but not frameworks.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're consuming content, but not creating products.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're learning, but you're not teaching.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the gap.
[SPEAKER_05]: The reason why
[SPEAKER_05]: this matters for entrepreneurship is because 90% of entrepreneurship is self-management if you ask me right you have to set your own time timetable for yourself you have to set your own standards you have to set your own system so it's basically self-management right but most people are managing the wrong thing they're managing their inputs inputs in terms of
[SPEAKER_05]: how many books they've read, how many podcasts they listen to, how many videos they've watched, how much knowledge they've gained, how many courses they buy.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're managing their inputs, but they should be, y'all should be managing your outputs.
[SPEAKER_05]: What frameworks can you create through, let's say, the highlights that you stored from your books, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: What products can you build from the frameworks that you created?
[SPEAKER_05]: What value you can deliver
[SPEAKER_05]: from the products that you create.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are the outputs that you should be thinking about.
[SPEAKER_05]: But in fact, most people are thinking about inputs.
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, guys, for the people who are just recently joined in, I would recommend you check out the thread that I've written just before hosting this space.
[SPEAKER_05]: By the way, it's exactly what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_05]: Extraction.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's on the Jumbotron above.
[SPEAKER_05]: Feel free to have a read through it while listening to the space.
[SPEAKER_05]: And any questions, please feel free to ask it in the purple pill.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or of course, please feel free to join the speaker section as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Jodell, if you'd like to interject any time, please feel free to raise your hand or just chime in whenever you feel the need to.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, so people should be thinking about managing your outputs, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: What frameworks you can create, what products you can build, what value you can deliver, what problems you can solve.
[SPEAKER_05]: i've understood that the market and i've i've understood this the hard way guys the market doesn't pay you for your inputs it pays you for your outputs nobody cares that you've read alex hormozy's hundred million offers nobody cares that you've read james clear's atomic habits they care if you can help them create an offer if you can solve their pain okay um
[SPEAKER_05]: the income gap is the gap between input and output that we were talking about and that's what we're fixing in today's space okay there are three gaps to for the input income gap okay there are three gaps that we're going to be talking about today the first gap is the consumption to capture gap
[SPEAKER_05]: People consume tons of information.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I said before, 72 GB of information per day we consume on an average human being through what through our daily experiences, through what we consume, through the Internet information that we gather, 72 GB worth of information.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we consume a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: but we capture poorly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me give you an example.
[SPEAKER_05]: You read a book, let's say, let's take Alex Ramosi's 100 million offers itself, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a great book, you read that book, you probably highlight 20 quotes, you get excited, you then close the book.
[SPEAKER_05]: right after highlighting 20 quotes two weeks later someone asks what did you learn from 100 million offers you have highlighted 20 quotes but you probably can talk to them about two or three maximum five frameworks right you remember that it was good but you remember there were frameworks like a lot more but you can't recall the exact details why because you consumed without capturing systematically
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: The problem is your brain.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is what Tiago Forte talks in his book, Building a Second Brain.
[SPEAKER_05]: Your brain is for having ideas and not storing them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Most people read books and retain 10 percent within two weeks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Without systematic capture, insights evaporate.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have.
[SPEAKER_05]: Think about it, guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have a thought or a breakthrough.
[SPEAKER_05]: or an aha moment while taking a shower.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And by the by the time you eat your breakfast, it's half half the thing that you thought about is probably lost.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So your brain is for having ideas and not storing them.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're consuming
[SPEAKER_05]: if you don't capture what you are consuming per day you're basically consuming for entertainment and not for asset building and this is guys I've built this habit of capturing information when possible and I've built this habit which did take time
[SPEAKER_05]: And things have changed drastically for me, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So basically what people, most people do is they consume information for entertainment, not for asset building.
[SPEAKER_05]: You think you're watching a YouTube video and you are moving forward in terms of knowledge, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: But you probably learn 10 frameworks from that YouTube, from the video.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you don't capture those frameworks, you've just watched it for entertainment, not for asset building, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: here's what systematic capture looks like and i'm going to be talking about the 1 1 1 method it's very simple guys um the 1 1 1 method or what i follow is the para method p-a-r-a
[SPEAKER_05]: P for projects, A for areas, R for resources, A again for archives.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we'll get to that later.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's talk about a simpler method called the 1-1-1 method.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what that is, is for every chapter in a book that you read or for every page that you read from a book or for every five minutes or 10 minutes of a video that you watch,
[SPEAKER_05]: You store one highlight.
[SPEAKER_05]: That highlight can be a key quote or a concept.
[SPEAKER_05]: You store it on your phone.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pull out your Apple Notes while watching the video or your Notion system while reading the book.
[SPEAKER_05]: Capture one highlight.
[SPEAKER_05]: The highlight can be in the form of a key quote or a concept.
[SPEAKER_05]: right the exact text you copy the exact text then one insight and insight means what this means to you
[SPEAKER_05]: right so the highlight is the exact text from the book or the video you copy it right one key quote you copy it into your notes and then you have one insight the insight is your interpretation of that highlight what it means to you right that and one action
[SPEAKER_05]: that's the one one one method guys it's fairly simple universally applicable one one one one highlight one insight and one action one action is how to apply this insight now the ways you can apply this insight is either you can create a video out of it post it online you can post a tweet about it simple start simple post a tweet about it a short post about it
[SPEAKER_05]: Or you can convert that small insight into a thread and post it on X.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you apply this?
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't necessarily need to immediately think about how you can apply this in your life.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can simply start by applying it and posting on it on X or creating a video posted on YouTube, anything as such.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is the one one one method.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to pause here and say a quick hello to Tiger Lily over here.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was it's nice to have you here, ma'am, and I'm glad that you could join.
[SPEAKER_05]: Please feel free to join the speaker section if you feel like you can chime into the conversation or of course, please just hang out there and definitely wonderful to have you here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now, let's take an example from atomic habits.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's say Atomic Habits has this quote, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: You do not rise to the level of your goals, you fall to the level of your systems, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a highlight.
[SPEAKER_05]: So save that highlight in either your Notion or your Apple Notes while if you're watching a video or a podcast, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Save that highlight.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's one highlight.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the insight from that can be
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I said, you do not rise to the level of your goals.
[SPEAKER_05]: You fall to the level of your system.
[SPEAKER_05]: Your goals can be, let's say, 10,000 followers or 10K MRR per month.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever your goal is.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's say it's 10,000 followers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just take a simpler goal at this point in time.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the insight, since that's the highlight, the insight from that can be
[SPEAKER_05]: if you're inconsistent can be my inconsistency is not a motivation problem it's a system problem if that makes sense guys because again um motivation is a fleeting emotion one day you're motivated to go to the gym the other day you're not right
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you have a system in place, it doesn't matter whether you're feeling good or you're feeling unmotivated, non-motivated.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what the term is, but it doesn't matter as long as you have a strong system built up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So your inconsistency is not really a motivation problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a system problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: That could be your insight.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And from that insight, the action that you can take
[SPEAKER_05]: is probably you can write a post saying that, guys, I've been a short post on X.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just an example that I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can put a post on why you've been inconsistent because you've probably not created a system or you can even go up to building a 90 minute work block with zero friction setup.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can prep work the night before any small action that you can take.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the one one one method.
[SPEAKER_05]: um i see the engineer is requested for the speaker stage wonderful to have him here um but you see the difference guys the difference is the highlight is what the author said the insight is what you interpreted out of it and the action is what you can do from your interpretation right so again
[SPEAKER_05]: when someone asks what did you learn from atomic habits i'm just taking atomic habits as an example right when someone asks what did you learn from atomic habits you have an answer immediately right because you've still not just saved the highlight you have written down your insight so it's getting etched in your brain and you've also taken an action on it right so it's getting double etched in your brain
[SPEAKER_05]: right you've applied it in your life so now you have an answer immediately right so that is the one one one method i want to say a quick hello to the engineer my friend it's wonderful to have you here it's been a while since we've spoken i want to take a quick pause and uh say hi to you uh also want to want to ask about have you heard from russ anytime soon
[SPEAKER_05]: It's good to see you again, BB.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's great to, yeah, it's been a while since we've spoken.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jodell, how are you doing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Hope you're having a good day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone else in the space, hope you're doing well.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have not.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have not spoken to Russ in probably about a month and a half, maybe two months.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he's taking a little bit of time off, which is unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like Russ.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I also just wanted to say this is a great topic and I think you're
[SPEAKER_03]: In my opinion, you're 100% correct.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do a lot of prepping, but we don't actually apply those skills.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're reading lots of Scott Adams, reading all of Scott Adams' books.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're reading Atomic Habits, The Power of Habit, everything else.
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the end of the day, what are you doing with it?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I really like your framing on this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, the engineer.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yes, I kind of I like Ross as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's an interesting person as well as he's funny.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it would be wonderful to have him back.
[SPEAKER_05]: But but yeah, it's been a while.
[SPEAKER_05]: That being said, engineer, I've I've I've been watching your success on X, especially in your live streams.
[SPEAKER_05]: Quite a lot of people have been joining.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think it would be an interesting
[SPEAKER_05]: interesting thing to do if we could kind of have a space on where we have you discuss about your growth journey, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I do remember the time when you had just started from YouTube as I think kind of a hobby, but then you have like so many watch hours or something.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that'll be an interesting space to have.
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_03]: I have 14 years of watch hours.
[SPEAKER_03]: it would take you 14 years to watch all my videos.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, it's unbelievable that for me, that's a success right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I have a lot of views, millions of views.
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually don't care too much about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the watch hours, the watch hours, what keeps people coming back.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that lets me know that that tells me there's something there in the market.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the market speaking to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and so,
[SPEAKER_03]: The, it's just getting started.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm, I'm having to start, I'm having to build out the backend now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, there's some other things that I need to do as far as business wise.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, what I need to do with circuits FM to square everything away because you're right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, it started off as a hobby and you know what Kevin O'Leary would say, if, if you're not making any money, it's a hobby, but the problem is I'm past that point now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so now it's like, what do I do with it?
[SPEAKER_03]: And regarding the live streams on X, um,
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to try to find a way to be able to distribute and share the music through X.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was the mode of operation that I felt was the best for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I joined one of his live streams.
[SPEAKER_05]: I could stay in for about 10, 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it was fairly interesting, fairly energetic, and lively as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of comments and questions being asked in the live chat.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that is amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I did have a question in mind.
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway, I mean, it's fantastic to have you here, engineer.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have anything else to add before I can move to Jordel's hand?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, great conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm enjoying it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could count on me being here most days supporting you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like this space.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like what you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: That product sells itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as far as I'm concerned,
[SPEAKER_03]: This is just a great space.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just a couple of things real quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like your framing, the knowing between earning, the gap right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Consumption between capture.
[SPEAKER_03]: Both of those, I wrote those down, I put gaps between them, and I really like those framing, because I'm thinking about circuits FM and some of the things I've done before, and then you putting that right there in my face, saying, hey, doc, check this out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate you putting on these spaces at this time.
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate you saying that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for the kind words, Engineer, and I appreciate you being here as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to move to Jodell.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's up, Jodell?
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, VB.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hey, Doc.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice to see you and catch you in a space at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, as you were speaking, VB, Doc and I have talked about lots of times the power of habits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really like in the action, right, that you find the success.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can be something as small as making your bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're big proponents of making your bed every morning because it just builds momentum, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're starting your day off with a win.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to say too with, um, so I have a YouTube channel, super small, and I read one book.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got me so motivated that I made the channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, and then because I had something to work with, I was able to watch videos and I like, I never finished a video.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hardly ever finish a book because I get an idea and I put it down and I action on that idea right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: because I know it'll just like vaporize.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I had my YouTube channel, I would watch one hyper specific video to tweak one thing because I would make one thing better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead of watching a whole bunch of ideas, I would just focus on the one, make it better for that video, and then, you know, on my next video, tackle something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: but you know my my videos were was it was just a hobby but don't mistake a hobby for like it can be a stepping stone and when i did my videos it got me a lot of clarity on my speaking it got me clarity on what i wanted to be talking about and it led me to this path of where i wrote a book and now i am making money from my book so
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because it's a hobby today doesn't mean that it's like not teaching you something and getting more clarity on what you can actually make money at.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, great space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Freaking love this topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I could wake up at like 3 a.m. every morning just to listen to you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or I wish I could host a space later.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have, I actually work two jobs right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: I consider X as a full time job, which I consider it as, you know, kind of like play.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not really like work for me because I love reading and writing and of course not talking in spaces.
[SPEAKER_05]: But then after like six, seven, I kind of have a part time job that I've undertaken after my marriage to kind of pay my bills.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm fortunate enough to have landed a good job.
[SPEAKER_05]: which has enabled me to hire a VA for myself who is helping me kind of repurpose my content from X to
[SPEAKER_05]: YouTube, by the way I have a YouTube channel as well, very small at this point, about 15 something subscribers, about 15 something watch hours, YouTube, Instagram, Substack and LinkedIn as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Repurposing my content from X to other platforms is my VA's job.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, since I'm on this platform, I would love to definitely hear from both you guys in the doc as well as Jodell on your journey on the platform.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to go back to the point where you said that you pick up one concept from a book that you are reading and you apply it immediately.
[SPEAKER_05]: You write it down and then apply it because you feel like it gets lost.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's a great way to do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: They do call it the Pareto principle, the 20-80 principle, where you read 20% of the book, but you gather 80% of the information from the book, by the way.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the 80-20 or the 20-80, whatever you call it, works amazingly well, especially when you're reading books.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't have to go through the entire book sometimes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes you can just go through the 20% of the book and gather 80% of information that it has for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that's one good way to read books and that's what Jodell has applied over here which has definitely helped you out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for sharing that Jodell, I didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, moving back to the topic at hand.
[SPEAKER_05]: so guys when you follow the one one one principle right the method one one one method one highlight one insight and one action right what's the highlight from the podcast that you're watching uh 10 minutes of the podcast that you watched or one page of the book that you read or one um let's say video that you watched right what's the highlight store that highlight
[SPEAKER_05]: and then what's your insight from it, what this means to you, your interpretation of it, and what's the one action that you can take.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mind you guys, this is just step one.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are going to go to step three to understand how you can monetize from here, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: How you can actually create a product from here.
[SPEAKER_05]: So step one is actually capturing, and this is how you capture.
[SPEAKER_05]: Capturing is not just storing the highlight.
[SPEAKER_05]: Capturing is understanding deeply
[SPEAKER_05]: what you've what you've stored right deeply in a way that when someone asks you what did you learn exactly you have an immediate answer and also you can go in depth with that answer probably you can tell how you have applied it in your life as well so that is the one one one system
[SPEAKER_05]: to capture your notes the other way to capture your notes and this is kind of my favorite way is the para system now this i've taken directly from building a second brain by tiago forte his book the para system where p is for projects
[SPEAKER_05]: A is for areas, R is for resources, A is for archives.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would definitely recommend for the listeners to kind of have their notes pulled out for this because this can come in handy, either a pen and paper or some kind of notes for this.
[SPEAKER_05]: This will definitely help out.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to say a quick hi to Antonia as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for joining in, my friend.
[SPEAKER_05]: Para method for building a second brain this is literally a second brain your notes are your second brain right so projects you create four folders right four pages let's say you have a notion template you work on notion so you create four pages one is for projects which is your active work your active work can be either client delivery either product building
[SPEAKER_05]: or you could also be working on let's say fitness right that could be your current project as well fitness right you're going to the gym right and it's usually kind of uh short to medium term your projects should usually be short to medium term because um it must have an end date right uh any product that you're building will have an end date right you will be building a product for about three to six months ideally if it's a great product right
[SPEAKER_05]: So it must have an end date.
[SPEAKER_05]: So one folder for projects, one folder for areas.
[SPEAKER_05]: Areas are something that are never ending, your ongoing responsibilities, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Projects are ending.
[SPEAKER_05]: They can have an ending.
[SPEAKER_05]: Areas have no ending.
[SPEAKER_05]: So ongoing responsibilities like health, business, relationships,
[SPEAKER_05]: with your wife, your friends, you can still store notes about it while walking on the street, you might have a thought about health or your business, boom, pull out your phone, pull out your notion template and then write your thought about it, immediately get stored, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So ongoing responsibilities, that's your areas folder, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Third one is resources.
[SPEAKER_05]: So resources are your topics of interest like
[SPEAKER_05]: book notes that you organized by theme, any kind of frameworks that you have caught from anything that you've watched or any creator on X that you follow.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's put out a framework or a thread out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Store that thread immediately in your resources.
[SPEAKER_05]: Resources are something that you can go into immediately and then gather it and pull it into your projects folder.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what basically it is about, resources.
[SPEAKER_05]: And number four is archives.
[SPEAKER_05]: Guys, so projects have an end date, areas don't have an end date, they are ongoing.
[SPEAKER_05]: resources are something that you pull from for your current projects right you might have stored a couple of highlights couple of insights from a book that you're reading and while working on your project folder you might be thinking hey i actually have this in my resources section go to your resources pull it from there bring it into your projects right so resources are
[SPEAKER_05]: also always there ongoing but archives are the inactive stuff for example you have finished a project right move the entire project into your archives but don't delete it because you might have some information stored in there for your next project that you have right um
[SPEAKER_05]: one thing to keep in mind guys is for your para to actually be functioning you have to kind of have a goal in mind a goal is your current project but you should not have more than three to five current if you ask me more than three to five because you can't be focusing on a lot of things
[SPEAKER_05]: at once otherwise you will spread yourself too thin and you will not be able to go deep into one particular project that is number one number two is the kind of notes that you want to capture is also very important because people capture a lot of notes all kinds of notes they think that it's very important but you have to understand if the thing that you want to capture right now
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it valuable and immediately actionable in your current project that you are working on, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: If it is not immediately actionable within the next three to five months until the project, then you are not going to save it in your notes because that will overwhelm you and your notes app is just going to be overfilled and it'll just be hoarding information, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's one thing to understand while you're capturing notes as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: So guys, basically this is how I've been maintaining for the past three months.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been using the Para method for building a second brain for myself and all my book notes go into resources, all my YouTube notes go into resources and I store in some major highlights and insights into my resources section of my Notion and I also put in the entire link of the YouTube video inside my Notion.
[SPEAKER_05]: i don't just have the highlights if i need to go deeper and watch the whole thing again the link is right there right so this is one amazing way uh to save your notes um which is which i highly recommend what people do these days is and what i used to do is i used to save my notes through topics right i used to
[SPEAKER_05]: put topics like okay atomic habits so and so 100 million offers so and so fitness how to get six packs so and so how to get abs in six months so and so that's not the right way the right way would be projects areas resources and archives your tasks get much much simpler feel free to dm me for more information about this i have also written a thread about this i think last week or two weeks ago so i will feel free to dm me and i will share you the entire thread
[SPEAKER_05]: on my way of doing this if you have any questions or doubts and guys feel free to ask me questions as well i do have my while i'm on my phone speaking on the space i am i'm in my my laptop is in front of me so i'm going through the comments as well so feel free to ask any questions
[SPEAKER_05]: if you come across any kind of doubts or queries.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to say a quick hello to Fabio as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for joining in my friend.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been a while since I've seen you in the space, in my space at least.
[SPEAKER_05]: So thanks for joining in.
[SPEAKER_05]: Feel free to hop on the speaker section.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to go to go to Judel now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, thanks, Phoebe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hi, Fabio.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice to see you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I was just going to say that, you know, I also like I would recommend Find What Works for You because I tried Notion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried, you know, a bunch of different
[SPEAKER_00]: tools to capture my ideas and for me it just it was really complicated because when my ideas came it was usually like when I was driving or walking around a store or something like that so I just got really good at saying like hey Siri and then like usually my idea was like three words just strung together that I liked the way I put them together in my mind and I knew if I didn't write it down right away I would lose it
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I start small because I think what, you know, VB, you want to start building that momentum and just start building that habit because I think so many people overthink the whole process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yours is like the pinnacle of where you want to get to, but if you're not doing anything, that gap can feel really big sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, just start, just start with whatever works.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, VB is like the ultimate success story for this idea generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Jodell.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, I think the great point that you mentioned is start small and that's amazing to say because it was not that I had the para system entirely figured out three months ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it was
[SPEAKER_05]: I was figuring out as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now, since I've worked, I treat my notion as my workspace, so I've kind of played around with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I spent some time over there, so it functions.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I'm fairly advanced in that section, but starting small is a great tip, and thanks for sharing that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's one thing, guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: To create a new habit or to adopt a new habit, you have to start small.
[SPEAKER_05]: For example, you can't
[SPEAKER_05]: Think about starting to meditate from tomorrow for 60 minutes directly.
[SPEAKER_05]: You start small, build a small, take a small step towards it, maybe two minutes of meditation, five minutes of meditation.
[SPEAKER_05]: You start there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to say pause here and say a quick hello to Will and bring him up on stage as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for joining in, Will.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wonderful to have you here as usual.
[SPEAKER_05]: Appreciate you here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Feel free to contribute whenever you feel the need to.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were just talking about how to organize notes and we were talking about the para method for building a second brain and how I use it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, guys,
[SPEAKER_05]: all my book notes go into resources and books resources in the para for para kind of system of mine and when i need to find something i find it in like five seconds if you ask me to find a thread and share it with you i can share it with you in five seconds like your notes become accessible to you which means if they are accessible they are usable for you
[SPEAKER_05]: and if they are usable you it means it's monetizable right your notes are literally what uh create income from you for you if you ask me your notes are literally your income system and let's talk about the income connection i want to get fabio on stage as well um let's talk about the income connection over here and here's why this matters because if your knowledge is scattered across let's say five apps
[SPEAKER_05]: your phone screenshots your head apple notes the notion and then another let's say google doc you can't really package your notes you can't really package them you can't sell from an empty warehouse let me put it that way systematic capture equals organized inventory organized inventory equals ability to sell
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the gap, number one, which we have covered.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I want to move quickly to Will, because I'm sure he has some valuable inputs on this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Over to you, Will.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, you keep setting me up with these really interesting conversations.
[SPEAKER_01]: But hi, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, one thing I was going to say, based on that was, when you've got your, and this is true for everything, right, when you've got your resources in several different places,
[SPEAKER_01]: You're running many mental loops trying to keep track of all those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not just a case of 1 plus 1 plus 1 equals 3.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's a case of 1 plus 1 plus the resource needed to find the second one equals 4.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is exponentially higher the more open loops you have.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is why, you know, we talked about focus the other day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why I'm so big on internal discipline of focus is because for every open loop you have, you're more scattered.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now maybe 60% of your resources are just trying to, are used, trying to remember where the other 40% go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is a, a very dangerous loop to find yourself in because like we said, you can find yourself incredibly busy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then at the end of the day, you look back and you're like, but I accomplished barely anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why am I so tired?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's because beneath the conscious mind, your brain was doing all kinds of backflips, trying to remember things, trying to make associations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the goal of Tiago Forde's book, which is a great book, by the way, Build a Second Brain, is like reduce the mental overhead and use the brain for what it was designed for, which is to have ideas to make those in the moment connections and then get it out of your brain and onto the page.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then know where the page is so that when you need that again, you can come back to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, you know, I've said this many times, this is kind of like my own little quip on that, but like the brain is amazing at ideas and it is terrible at memory.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because as a rule, it's not designed for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you, your brain was designed to remember where the berries are.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you didn't go hungry, but that was about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not designed to do all the advanced 15 Chrome tabs, open tasks that we do today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the idea behind this is so interesting, Vivi.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I really.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really love the conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've got like the next 20, 25 minutes free.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm happy to have a great conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to say hi as well to the engineer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has been far too long since we've spoken.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you're doing well.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am doing well.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's good to see you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I hope everything is going well with you.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going amazing with him.
[SPEAKER_05]: He has, uh, I think launched, um,
[SPEAKER_05]: um low ticket offer as well right now um quite recently so i can tell you from third perspective that he's doing fantastically well i guess i hope i'm right um yeah and thanks for sharing will that was uh
[SPEAKER_05]: That was absolutely insightful once again.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yes, you're absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Your brain is not meant to store information.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's meant to create ideas.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's funny you said the brain is terrible for memory because the moment you said that, I remember Bob Proctor's kind of statements on his seminars back in the day when he used to
[SPEAKER_05]: be like, I can guarantee you, I can tell you guys that I have a perfect memory.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's because he used to say, like, it's something that he claimed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on that point, I said, I said, you know, the memory, the brain is terrible at remembering, most of the time, you can train it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like memory is one of the perceptual, one of the mental faculties that you can train.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are amazing techniques that you can use to make those associations and you can develop a great memory for certain things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the beauty of having it all in an external system is that you can remove that mental overhead and use the brain for the majority of the time, purely as creation, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the way I like to look at this is, you know, when you're playing Lego, right, as a kid,
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the difference between, if anyone else had this experience, you'll probably relate.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a big bucket full of Lego, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: How much time do you spend in the bucket, moving the pieces around, looking for the one you want versus if you had nice, neat piles of all the different Lego blocks, same situation, same problem, same desired outcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: But because everything's neatly organized, your brain does not need to go into the bucket of Lego and scoop around and look for the one piece you need, which is usually very small.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the goal is ease of access to the information.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you can develop such a perfectly organized box of Lego that when you go in there, you know where every piece is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that does take time.
[SPEAKER_01]: That does take mental overhead.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the idea is, yeah, like he says in the power system, when you offload all of that
[SPEAKER_01]: to a system that's really designed for that, you're working to your strengths and you're leveraging the strengths of something outside of you that does it better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I think it's just really important to say, you can absolutely create a perfect memory.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am of the belief that the human being can do anything they set their mind to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't just mean that in the motivational, you can do it sense, because that is true.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if you can conceive it, and this is Napoleon Hill, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can conceive it and believe it, you can achieve it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have yet to see that fail.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know, I know the reason why it will never fail, but yeah, really wanted to speak on that because the goal is to organize your information and data so that you need no mental overhead to go to the data, find it, break the flow state.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's so good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh,
[SPEAKER_05]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you set your mind to something and you actually believe in it and you've done the most, you really work towards it, it's rare that you don't achieve it.
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, I think unless some terrible circumstances, you can always achieve it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever you set your mind to and you've done everything that you could.
[SPEAKER_05]: Purely as creation is what your brain was meant for.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like Will said in terms of the Lego blocks example, I would like to also say that your brain actually uses a lot of brain energy to, if you are number one, trying to remember things and trying to decide things.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when you wake up in the morning and you have to decide, okay, what do I do right now?
[SPEAKER_05]: What do I do right now?
[SPEAKER_05]: What do I do next?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you're using up
[SPEAKER_05]: mental energy for deciding what to do when you could use that for creating stuff so when you sit down to actually work and if you have all the stuff out there already almost packaged for you and ready for use
[SPEAKER_05]: you're now good to go and create valuable stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: So your brain is definitely purely for creation and not necessarily for going back and forth for memory purposes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to say a quick hello to Timo who has requested for the mics.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm bringing him up here but guys that is gap one that we discussed and for the people who are just joined in I've
[SPEAKER_05]: I have written a thread on this exact space that we are kind of going through.
[SPEAKER_05]: So check the Jumbotron and read while you're listening as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we went through to gap one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so the gap one is basically the consumption to capture gap.
[SPEAKER_05]: People consume a lot, they think they are moving forward in terms of progress, but they're just consuming and they forget 90% of what they consume.
[SPEAKER_05]: and retain only 10% and when you ask them what did you learn they barely have anything to say if they don't capture so capturing is gap number one and you have to find the right method to capture if you want to build a habit to capture start small like jodel was saying she
[SPEAKER_05]: drives in our car and then voice notes to Siri, I guess, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how I started as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how I built a habit while I'm on a walk.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't, I didn't really go to my quick notes on my Apple notes and capture, write it down.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just Siri'd it, voice noted.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I also downloaded this app called auto.ai, which I have created a premium version of auto.ai as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: fairly cheap and it's very useful whatever you capture on your voice gets transcripted into words and then you can boom just immediately paste it in your notion folder that's what I do so it's a good use of my let's say 17 dollars per month but
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's move on.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanna quickly check in and say hello to Fabio and Timo as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for joining in, guys, and feel free to jump in or chime in whenever you feel the need to.
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's talk about the second kind of gap that most creators face is they capture notes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now that you've built the habit to capture your notes, what do you do next, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: You now,
[SPEAKER_05]: It's about extracting frameworks from what you capture.
[SPEAKER_05]: And here's what I mean.
[SPEAKER_05]: What I mean is you've captured highlights.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have your notes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe you even have them organized in, let's say, Notion or whatever your notes app is, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: But when someone asks you, what do you teach?
[SPEAKER_05]: You still have no answer, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because notes highlights don't sell.
[SPEAKER_05]: frameworks is what sells right that's the critical distinction guys i want to explain the difference over here is basically consuming is equal to reading a book maybe taking highlights maybe watching a youtube video or a podcast whatever it is but extracting is sitting for 60 to 90 minutes and asking what's the framework here
[SPEAKER_05]: Most people, I'm just talking out of experience, guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: I used to be a part of this.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why I can talk about this so deeply because most people, including my past self, do a lot of consumption.
[SPEAKER_05]: Almost nobody does extraction.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm pulling directly from a deep work here, the current book that I'm reading.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we had a conversation about Carl Jung yesterday.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to bring it up once again today.
[SPEAKER_05]: Carl Jung actually built a tower called Bollingen Tower.
[SPEAKER_05]: He went to the woods, to the forest, away from his family to think deeply and built his own tower out of stone.
[SPEAKER_05]: Why?
[SPEAKER_05]: To think deeply.
[SPEAKER_05]: He locked himself in his private office for like two hours every single day.
[SPEAKER_05]: He didn't just read Sigmund Freud's work.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he was someone who opposed Sigmund Freud's work.
[SPEAKER_05]: And back in the 1920s, Sigmund Freud was huge and opposing him was like suicide, by the way.
[SPEAKER_05]: But he didn't just read his work.
[SPEAKER_05]: He extracted counter frameworks.
[SPEAKER_05]: and those counter frameworks is where his income came from and that's why we're still talking about him in 2025.
[SPEAKER_05]: His frameworks didn't come from reading, his frameworks came from extracting and I want to talk about what extraction really looks like.
[SPEAKER_05]: Extraction basically looks like this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's say you're reading a book.
[SPEAKER_05]: or a podcast or a video that you're watching anything as such or maybe you just spent time in a workshop whatever it is i'm just going to take an example of reading a book chapter right so let's say you're reading a book you spent 60 minutes reading a book after reading the book you don't just save the highlights in your notion folder or your apple notes you open a blank google doc
[SPEAKER_05]: you ask yourself one question the question is if you had to teach this to let's say 10 people tomorrow this exact chapter that you read this exact page it doesn't have to be an entire chapter of a book if you had to teach this page
[SPEAKER_05]: to 10 people tomorrow, what would you say?
[SPEAKER_05]: How would you say it?
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you simply write it down for the next 30-45 minutes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I say 30-45 minutes because that's the usual deep work time block that I think is
[SPEAKER_05]: is most useful here i'm not a big fan of the pomodoro technique that's only 25 i mean i'm not sure if it really works at all because at the minute 20 25 is when i actually get into deep focus mode
[SPEAKER_05]: um but yeah i mean if you had to teach this to 10 people tomorrow what would you say and how would you say it that is what extraction looks like that is the difference between consuming versus extracting i want to say a quick hello to neda as well thanks for joining in neda please feel free to jump into the speaker section whenever you feel the need to if you feel to contribute guys
[SPEAKER_05]: please like and reshare the space as well it does help a lot in terms of promoting the space and getting a lot more interesting people over here number one number two is for the people just joining in make sure to go through the thread which is on the jumbotron above it's exactly what we're talking about also you can simply copy paste this entire thread put it in your chat gpt right and
[SPEAKER_05]: be like hey man how do i extract this entire framework and apply it to my current project guys you will find answers which you may have been missing out on this is really helpful um
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's move to Will.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, over to you, Will.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just really quick, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because this is what I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you mentioned chat GPT, which is what I use for this, but like any LLM with a voice function will work.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like, I read a lot of books, as you know, and what I do at the end of a chapter is I'll put the highlights that I thought were important into chat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will say, you're a student that knows nothing about this, ask me questions that most people would ask.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's my job on the voice chat then to interpret it in my own way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, it's exactly what he says, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's extraction, but it's through the medium of teaching.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really good for that deeper integration, because now you've got to make those connections in the brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you've got to actually store that in a way that is memorable to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: and that will help you retain the information.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the stats show that if you read a book once and you put it down and you never go back to it, you'll retain about five to 10% of the information.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas if you teach it and you actually have to go through the process of learning with it, and it's time under attention, so you are spending more time with it, then you will be able, and I love that one,
[SPEAKER_01]: That's true though.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I got to give you, I've got to say as well, isn't it very early there where you are?
[SPEAKER_01]: So love the dedication.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, the idea is that when you teach someone, you learn something better, and that's a very well-known fact.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now we all have an eager student with ChatGPT.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just be very clear with the instructions, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know nothing about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ask me questions at a grade three level, a grade four level, a grade five level, and challenge my answers.
[SPEAKER_01]: if they are incomplete, and it will force you to go back and actually learn something so that you can put it in a way that someone can understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a very useful practice.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I love the tip here is to ask chat GPT in terms of, OK, you are somebody who knows nothing about this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ask me a lot of questions on this.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's a wonderful way to figure out the questions that you can be asked in terms of a certain topic.
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, the answers that you can give.
[SPEAKER_05]: Number two.
[SPEAKER_05]: Number three is I love the teaching framework that you use because that's exactly what I use my spaces for as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: So thanks for bringing that up.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would love to move to Timo because it's been a while since I had Timo on the speaker section in my spaces.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that was like 8-10 months ago, but it's lovely to have you back here, Timo.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Vivi and Will, everyone, Katachi.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a whole bunch of friends here already.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, just well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Will was saying, another thing that I posted about last weekend was with all these AI tools, if you do want to, you can now build all kinds of weird things depending on what the best medium for you to remember stuff is.
[SPEAKER_02]: For instance, I posted my son used Google
[SPEAKER_02]: AI studio, he dumped all his he took, he got photos of his English.
[SPEAKER_02]: This fall semester English studies, and he dumped them all into Google AI studio, and he built an app that had
[SPEAKER_02]: all kinds of different questions and missions that he had to complete by answering or choosing correct answers or typing down the correct answers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was basically just click, wait, and go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, well, he needed the VS Code to launch the app.
[SPEAKER_02]: But other than that, it was just full AI.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now with NotebookLM, what I do with my newsletter nowadays is I also offer a video explanation of the article every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I dump them to YouTube and share them on my newsletter article.
[SPEAKER_02]: But basically, the framework is that after writing the article, I throw it into NotebookLM.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have a certain type of prompt that turns that
[SPEAKER_02]: article into maybe even a deeper dive explanation video, which I then throw into YouTube and then drop it into the article.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you can do a podcast and Notebook LM podcasts are such that if you are using it on the Notebook LM app, which is actually totally free,
[SPEAKER_02]: You can take part on, if you turn it into a podcast, whatever text you have written, whatever thing you want to learn, you can turn it into a podcast and there is an interruption button where you can go and jump in on to the podcast and start a conversation with the two AI hosts and maybe ask questions from them and take part of the conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's all kinds of these things depending on which is the best
[SPEAKER_02]: way you kind of learn these things because reinforcement learning is a thing for us humans too even though it's thrown around with AI a lot lately but that's how we learn and then sleep on it and you'll be even more smarter in the morning.
[SPEAKER_05]: The term reinforcement learning is very important to understand here fellow friends over here because
[SPEAKER_05]: That's something that we don't do.
[SPEAKER_05]: Most people don't do.
[SPEAKER_05]: They consume information.
[SPEAKER_05]: And by the way, thanks Timo for the valuable insights as usual.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, guys, firstly, if you're not following Timo, I think it's high time that you do.
[SPEAKER_05]: And number two is if you want to reach out for any kind of advice on AI or LLM, anything that you want to use with technology, you can reach out to him.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have personally,
[SPEAKER_05]: changed or moved direction from GPT to Claude completely because of Timo's recommendation.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I have to say, I'm pretty satisfied, much satisfied with Claude than what I was with GPT.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, reinforcement learning.
[SPEAKER_05]: you've got to find ways to do that guys to retain information because information is not just to be collected it's to be retained and you can retain information through number one using the help of AI.
[SPEAKER_05]: Number two is also like Will said teach it teach about it right and this is the kind of reinforcement learning that I'm doing through my spaces over here because this is one way where I get to talk about what I learned
[SPEAKER_05]: When I talk about what I learned to real people, it helps me retain a lot more information.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's one way of applying information for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: So thanks for that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, let's move on to what we were actually talking about and move back to the topic.
[SPEAKER_05]: Carl Jung, back in 1922, he built a tower in the woods, right, out of stone.
[SPEAKER_05]: He built it himself and no electricity, just a lamp and his books and his notes and a pen and paper, of course.
[SPEAKER_05]: He built a tower called the Bollingen Tower.
[SPEAKER_05]: The reason he built it was because he wanted to think deeply.
[SPEAKER_05]: He understood that he was getting distracted not for 10 minutes, not for 15 minutes, but every small distraction by his family.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe for two minutes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now when you're distracted for two minutes, you have to get back into focus.
[SPEAKER_05]: It takes about 13 to 23 minutes according to research.
[SPEAKER_05]: to get back to the same kind of focus that you were in.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he understood this and he built a tower in the woods.
[SPEAKER_05]: So to think deeply, he locked himself in what he called his private office.
[SPEAKER_05]: He didn't read Sigmund Freud's work.
[SPEAKER_05]: He extracted counter frameworks and that's where his income came from.
[SPEAKER_05]: His income didn't come from reading or consuming information.
[SPEAKER_05]: His income came from extracting information, extracting what Sigmund Freud's work did and creating counter frameworks.
[SPEAKER_05]: And here's what you guys can do as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: What you can do is I'm going to take a book.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to take an example of a book.
[SPEAKER_05]: But whatever information that you're consuming, maybe it's your everyday life.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe it's a video that you're watching on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe it's a podcast that you're listening to.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: After you listen to a podcast, don't just close the podcast and then.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go carry on with your day, you open your notes app, maybe start small,
[SPEAKER_05]: You open your quick notes on your Apple iPhone or whatever you're using.
[SPEAKER_05]: I open Notion, but open a blank Google Doc as well, if possible, if that's what you use and ask yourself if you had to teach this exact chapter that you read, if you had to teach this exact framework that you learned from this podcast to 10 people tomorrow,
[SPEAKER_05]: What would you say and how would you say it right and then simply write it down.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is deep work guys write it down without Distraction without getting distracted by your notifications on your phone or by notifications on X Because you will not be able to pull Pull out the full essence of your writing if you get distracted even for few seconds from your engagements or notifications, that's the
[SPEAKER_05]: let's say drawback of the information age, if you ask me, these kind of distractions.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, the reason why, and extraction is where you,
[SPEAKER_05]: let's say the deep kind of stuff is created, stuff of incredible value is created.
[SPEAKER_05]: And most people skip this because extraction is hard.
[SPEAKER_05]: It requires you to pull away from distractions.
[SPEAKER_05]: It requires you to apply yourself completely.
[SPEAKER_05]: It requires protected time.
[SPEAKER_05]: It requires deep focus.
[SPEAKER_05]: It requires somewhat uncomfortable thinking.
[SPEAKER_05]: and most people avoid this it's easier to read another book another chapter it's easier to re-watch another video it's easier to to just carry on with your day after one chapter right but here's the thing reading equals input extraction equals output and your income
[SPEAKER_05]: literally comes from your output and not your input.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is the thing, guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is exactly what it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is about output.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would like to go back to the hands.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know who raised first, but feel free, anybody over here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe you will, and then we'll go to Timo.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wanted to add something to this point you were making there about
[SPEAKER_01]: the tendency that we have to read another book, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That fallacy that we don't know enough to start.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's something quite sinister about this, which your brain does.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the idea is, right, reading about something does two things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It increases the gap between your potential and your current position.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the reasons I have found that people who read a lot of books, but don't take a lot of action, which is, again, I want to bring this into the topic of the space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very smart people who stay broke is they have a massive amount of knowledge, but a very small amount of actual implementation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the gap between what they know is possible for them and where they view themselves to be actually gets wider.
[SPEAKER_01]: the more they learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they actually feel worse about their current situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is why so many people who are very intelligent, very smart, are in positions where they feel so bad about themselves, so unconfident, so in that space of they know their potential is so big, but they don't feel like they're living it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They feel unfulfilled.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things that can cause that is this gap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because think about it like a mountain graph, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If your potential just keeps going up and you never catch up with it, of course the gap's gonna get wider.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's wider than the people who never even learned it in the first place.
[SPEAKER_01]: But because your potential's higher, your skill ceiling is now higher, you actually have the potential for a higher expression of life.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you must keep up with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's one reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other thing I wanted to add here was
[SPEAKER_01]: When you reach for another book, you're doing two things to the brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're telling the brain, I don't know enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: I must keep learning more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And guys, I read books every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I spend about an hour a day reading.
[SPEAKER_01]: You never have all the knowledge, but you must have the idea that I know enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm confident in my ability to figure it out and get the information as and when I need it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what put you into action because what the brain will do in order to keep you safe and protected because it really only cares about keeping you safe, keeping you alive, keeping you predictable and effectively then safe is while you're learning.
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not actually in any danger, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can think about starting a business, you can tell people you're going to start a business, you can, you know, plan it all out in your day in your planner.
[SPEAKER_01]: But unless you actually take the physical step, the nervous system doesn't understand that anything's happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you take that first step into action, it's terrifying.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get that cortisol spike.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your amygdala goes nuts because now something's unpredictable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something's happening outside of you that isn't part of the status quo, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Now your body's paying attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now your brain is wired to like, where's the threat?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where's the threat?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why it's much easier and safer to reach for another book.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the brain will like, yeah, read as much as you want, plan the business as much as you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell all the people on social media that you're going to do it as much as you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, we'll reward you have some dopamine, stay safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the moment you step out to doing it, it is inherently uncomfortable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the truth of change is you can have whatever you want, but not as the person you are now, because your output is direct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you said, VB, your output is directionally proportional to your input and your input is who am I being right now?
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a very sneaky trap here, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you keep reading books, feeling like you don't know enough, you're telling your brain, I am not enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just hearing, got it boss.
[SPEAKER_01]: More of that, more of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't know enough, better read some more books.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not safe to start right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just stay where we are in this comfortable place where we know where things are going to be, even though it's not what we want.
[SPEAKER_01]: it's predictable, it's comfortable, or maybe not even comfortable, maybe it's just predictable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the other part is, as you stay more and more in that space, with an increased potential and a decreased activity, or a decreased congruence, we'll say with your desired self, the gap gets wider, and now you feel less fulfilled.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you want fulfillment and success, the way to do it, I like to teach people is like a caterpillar, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes, the front end goes ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: You read, you learn some stuff and then the backend has to catch up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how it actually makes progress.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that caterpillar just moved the front end of the backend, never caught up, it wouldn't go anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is sadly all too true of too many people.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get the potential, but they never meet it with an expression.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, two things, VB, just because I've thought about that a lot, about the people who are very smart, but very broke.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it comes down to one thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They never changed who they were being.
[SPEAKER_01]: They never changed who they were.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas somebody who doesn't know as much, but knows themselves, like I know enough, I'll figure it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can do anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they have that self-concept, that internal self-confidence in the fact that they can figure it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: they're going to take action.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they might have a third of the information, a 10th of the information, but if they know where to go get it, they're not going to allow it to stop them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can think of that idea of over-preparation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a defense mechanism to keep you stuck in the safe, in the predictable.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why broke people stay, sorry, smart people stay broke.
[SPEAKER_01]: and why broke people are often very eloquently able to explain everything but not able to put it into practice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just my two cents on that from someone who has been in that trap and found their way out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the answer, as always, is congruent action.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would like to also add
[SPEAKER_05]: I totally agree with what you said, Will, by the way.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is safer, it does feel safer and more comfortable as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it also is, if you read and if you don't extract, number one, or if you read and if you don't apply it in your life, number two, you're just reading for entertainment.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you watch a podcast and you don't actually extract frameworks or information from it, apply it in your life, you're just watching for entertainment.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you're watching a movie, there's no difference.
[SPEAKER_05]: in my eyes so people just want to continue to be entertained so they keep reading as let's say as a source of entertainment I think Timo had his hand up before this I would like to check back with him if he still has anything to add to this Timo over to you yeah yeah sorry I had some issues with I was on with the laptop and that as we all know it is just a horrible experience but anyways
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I like what we were saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and the reality is that it's taking action and applying the knowledge of whatever somebody calls being smart actually means.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, it's the, the power of taking action that actually makes the difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: The reality is also that, uh, even though these, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: I love these spaces where we talk about like human knowledge, but the reality of the future is that all the LLMs can just spin out all this knowledge, except like very high niched in, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: subject matter knowledge that you gain working in a different certain field but it's still a lack of application and lack of taking action that's going to keep
[SPEAKER_02]: even the best users of AI in the dark and in the poor zone.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I would also like to add is that the school system pretty much across at least in the West, especially in the North American countries, they are just
[SPEAKER_02]: monkey read, monkey do type of stuff where you're just like doing the learning curve of pike is a fish, pike is a fish, pike is a fish, pike is a fish and then you go to the test and say pike is a fish and then you forgot about it when you are not needing that information anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Children as a father of four
[SPEAKER_02]: If they're interested in a topic, they will read and re-read and re-read and re-watch any documentary that just covers the stuff they're interested about.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why they're like sponges and they do absorb the information.
[SPEAKER_02]: The school system is highly
[SPEAKER_02]: geared towards success, meaning avoiding mistakes, avoiding failure, when then anything that you can turn into applicable skills or knowledge actually requires you to fall on your face and climb up and do it again until you either
[SPEAKER_02]: never get up or or like I say champion stand up one more time than the rest so you champion whatever thing you're doing and then acquire that knowledge that is needed for that whatever it is you're trying to learn.
[SPEAKER_05]: A hundred percent and thanks for sharing that Timo.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you talk about children I totally agree with what you said and when you brought up the school system the only thing that came to my mind is
[SPEAKER_05]: The school system, while it sets you up for the success kind of trajectory, it also sets you up in a way to have this mindset.
[SPEAKER_05]: For example, when you have these exams and tests that you have to give, a student would have to, let's say, go through six to eight months of learning a particular subject or subjects and give an exam, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So they mug things up and they give this exam and then we go into the next grade and then we are given this idea that, okay, once we study this and once we give this exam, we probably don't need this kind of information anymore, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So that information is kind of lost.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you move on to the next grade, you get dumped with more information, you give another exam and then you finish the exam and boom, the notes again are vanished.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why from the very beginning we don't really have a right way for maintaining notes from the schooling days, I would say, which is why the PADA system of
[SPEAKER_05]: capturing notes that from building a second brain is absolutely vital and counters this kind of aspect where anything that you, let's say you complete a project, you don't throw it away.
[SPEAKER_05]: You keep it in your archives or your resources folder.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then let's say you started a new project and then you have something, you remember that, okay, this was actually done in my previous project.
[SPEAKER_05]: You pull that data from the resources and add it into your project.
[SPEAKER_05]: So your information is never really lost.
[SPEAKER_05]: But,
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, it's just one thing that came into my mind when you talked about children and school, Timo.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, getting back to the topic at hand, we spoke about the two gaps.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there are three total gaps for a creator to eventually get income.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we spoke about the first gap.
[SPEAKER_05]: The first gap was
[SPEAKER_05]: was simply the consumption to capture gap.
[SPEAKER_05]: You consume information and then we figured out how to capture information.
[SPEAKER_05]: The second gap is from capture to extraction gap.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we were just talking in depth about how to extract the information that you capture.
[SPEAKER_05]: Once you extract it, it's kind of become a part of you.
[SPEAKER_05]: You apply it in your life.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of become a part of you.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, so that is one way you can extract.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now the gap number three is, yes, you extract information, you derive frameworks from it, but now how do you monetize, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're going to be talking about the extraction to the monetization gap, guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I'm going to be running for about 15 more minutes on this space, and then we're going to close down.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we'll finish this gap, as I promised in the beginning of the space.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll talk about the three gaps, and then we will wind up.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to say a quick hello to Razwan as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been a while, my friend, since you joined the space.
[SPEAKER_05]: That being said, let's talk about the gap number three, where people who capture and extract frameworks, they do that, but do they know how to package what they extract?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the question, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So you capture and you extract frameworks, but you can't package them for sale.
[SPEAKER_05]: How are you going to make income?
[SPEAKER_05]: right you might have a framework you might even teach it in your threads or tweets or even your spaces but when it comes to selling it again you freeze right why because you're selling information again when it comes to extraction extracting frameworks you're selling information
[SPEAKER_05]: and you're not selling transformation and people pay for transformation, my friends, not really for information because information can be found in abundance.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody has access to unlimited information, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is where Alex Ramos's book, The Hundred Million Offers comes into play is because
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, his framework basically says, or Mosey says, make people an offer so good they feel stupid saying no.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you have to make people an offer so good they feel stupid saying no.
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you make an offer so good?
[SPEAKER_05]: You create such an amazing value, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: What is value?
[SPEAKER_05]: What is the value equation?
[SPEAKER_05]: I had this entire space about the value equation.
[SPEAKER_05]: I even wrote a thread about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But in short, the value equation is dream outcome.
[SPEAKER_05]: What is the outcome of your audience, of your client, into perceived likelihood of achievement?
[SPEAKER_05]: What is the likelihood that your client can achieve that dream outcome?
[SPEAKER_05]: So dream outcome into perceived likelihood of achievement
[SPEAKER_05]: divided by time delay okay how much time will it take to achieve that goal into effort and sacrifice how much effort do I have to put or does your client have to put to achieve that goal okay so again the value equation is dream outcome into perceived likelihood of achievement divided by time and effort
[SPEAKER_05]: that's pretty much it that's the value if you can increase your dream outcome and perceived likelihood of achievement and decrease the time of achieving that goal and the effort that your client needs to achieve that goal your value is going to be perceived as extremely high that is the value equation and now you know the value equation but this is what most people miss people
[SPEAKER_05]: like we spoke about extraction people don't pay for frameworks they pay for results they pay for transformation they pay for outcomes right so here's the difference between what good packaging looks like and bad packaging looks like okay the difference is and this is what most people do including myself in the past bad packaging looks like this number one
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll teach you how to be productive.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll help you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Organize your notes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll share my frameworks with you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, these are vague.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are not outcome dependent, no time frame, no method.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are bad packaging examples, whereas good packaging examples, what actually sells looks like this.
[SPEAKER_05]: okay it goes like go from i have knowledge to i have a product in two weeks so time is mentioned um so you're decreasing you're telling the exact time they'll achieve this you're telling exactly what they'll achieve right what the um journey they'll go from i'll have a knowledge do i have a product in two weeks it can also look like
[SPEAKER_05]: turn your scattered notes into a $500 product or a course in eight weeks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Turn your scattered notes into what's the outcome?
[SPEAKER_05]: $500 course in eight weeks.
[SPEAKER_05]: The time is mentioned here, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: extract three monetizable frameworks from the books you've already read in 60 days so the time is read is mentioned the journey is already already mentioned and to make it even more spicy guys you can add a guarantee to your offer so if you you can say that
[SPEAKER_05]: you can say things like go from I have a knowledge I have knowledge to I have a product in two weeks and if you don't build it in two weeks I'll help you build it until you do or probably I'll help you go from zero dollars to a thousand dollars in three months and if you don't achieve it in three months I will work with you until you achieve it
[SPEAKER_05]: right if you add a guarantee to it as well an additional guarantee that that spices things up and people are more prone to buy your stuff right so you see the difference guys difference from i'll help you or i'll help you monetize to go from zero dollars to a thousand dollars in two months and if you don't achieve it in two months i will work with you until you achieve it right so this is the difference right you see the difference
[SPEAKER_05]: you are talking to a specific person you are giving a specific outcome you are giving a specific time frame and you're also giving a specific method right so these are the things i hope these are the things um that make your offer so good that people actually feel stupid to say no this is exactly taken from hormozy's hundred million offers um
[SPEAKER_05]: and converted into how you can package your offer and sell it to people.
[SPEAKER_05]: So at this point in time, what I'm doing to my current clients is basically I'm helping them, number one, organize their scattered knowledge using the para setup.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's number one.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how I work with them in week one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Week two is what I'm going to do once they have their notes and everything organized from scattered notes because notes are everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: Notes is what creates your income.
[SPEAKER_05]: Once they have their notes organized, I help them extract one monetizable framework from their notes and package it into a sellable product.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's literally what I'm doing at this point in time and how I'm helping my two clients at this point in time.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a journey that I started quite recently and I would say that it's going fairly well.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in two weeks, they'll have something that actually is packaged and they can sell.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not me saying I'll help you with your notes.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's me saying in two weeks, you'll have a monetizable framework.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a specific outcome.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a specific time frame and it's a clear transformation.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: To go even further, I would like to bring in the Grand Slam offer from Hermosi himself.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, what does a Grand Slam offer look like?
[SPEAKER_05]: Grand Slam offer looks like this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Number one, you identify the dream outcome.
[SPEAKER_05]: what do they look like what does your audience or sorry what does your client's dream outcome look like that's number one point number two you identify the obstacles what are the obstacles they will come across what's stopping them from buying your solution right perhaps it's
[SPEAKER_05]: If your offer is lose 60 pounds in two weeks or two months, let's say two months, lose 60 pounds in two months, an obstacle can be, well, I don't want to change my diet.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, if I have to change my diet, do I have to eat a lot of veggies?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, do I have to, I have to work a lot, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: do a lot of core exercises right so these could be the obstacles if you're if that's what you're selling right so that's point number two you list out what your dream outcome is which is losing 60 pounds in two months what's the obstacle that your client could face right these could be the obstacles that they have in their mind and point number three is provide solution to each obstacle
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, whatever problem you think your customer will have, you provide a solution to them.
[SPEAKER_05]: For example, my customer or in the example that I gave, well, do I have to eat a lot of veggies?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the solution can be how to how to maintain your diet without adding in a lot of veggies you add in to that package.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Will I have to do this all by myself?
[SPEAKER_05]: What kind of exercises to do?
[SPEAKER_05]: So how to achieve your goal without you having to work for 60 minutes at the gym every day.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are the things that you add into your existing offer as bonuses.
[SPEAKER_05]: your offer is the main offer is the main selling point okay lose 60 pounds in two months right but the problems that they come across and the solutions to those problems can be added in as additional bonuses to your offer whatever you're selling
[SPEAKER_05]: right and these bonuses you can add in 10 bonuses 100 bonuses whatever right for example if my product is how to go from zero dollars to a thousand dollars in two months i mean any problem my customer can face can be like this uh well i'm not very good at tech well my bonus can be
[SPEAKER_05]: how I'm also, along with what I'm offering, I'll also give you how to build an offer or create $1,000, get to $1,000 without being good at tech.
[SPEAKER_05]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_05]: Another solution, another problem can be, well, I don't know how to create a Stripe account or Stripe on my sales page, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: You can add in another bonus saying that, well, this is how you create a Stripe offer, a Stripe account.
[SPEAKER_05]: whatever it is maybe they don't know how to create a sales page right how to create a sales page in 30 minutes or less boom package it into your original offer and sell them as bonuses to your original offer and the more bonuses guys and this is how Hermosy says that you can price your offer at whatever price you actually
[SPEAKER_05]: want to because now it is as valuable as it can be it solves all the problems and if you're helping someone get a thousand dollars in in like two months and they have to pay like five hundred dollars for it i mean they're getting thousand dollars in two months so they're getting their money's worth already number one and number two they'll now they have the skill so they can keep doing it again again again so why won't they pay you right so you can charge them even let's say five thousand dollars
[SPEAKER_05]: for your reach your first thousand dollars and they can reach five thousand dollars in five months and they can go even beyond in a year in a year they get twelve thousand and they paid only five thousand for it so this is how you price your uh product slash offer as much as possible or as much as you would like almost and this is how you create a grand slam offer according to hermosi um and that my friends is
[SPEAKER_05]: the income gap that we talked about.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you capture information, you extract information, you extract and then you package them into an offer like this.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's the logical sequence.
[SPEAKER_05]: The logical sequence is you organize your notes first, you extract frameworks from your notes second,
[SPEAKER_05]: and you package your notes, your frameworks and finally monetize them.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can't really extract from chaos.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't package what you haven't extracted.
[SPEAKER_05]: it's how it works your notes app is literally carrying your entire income that is the logical sequence the income connection basically is you're not selling help or coaching or knowledge you're selling two months for transformation to lose 60 pounds you're selling two weeks to monetize framework the more specific you are
[SPEAKER_05]: The better it is every single time and that is gap three.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's the complete bridge guys That's the complete formula the formula is Let's go with the gaps Let's recall revisit the gaps that we covered so far is basically number one is the consumption to capture gap So you have to organize what you consume number two is capture to extract gap
[SPEAKER_05]: which means you have to turn notes into frameworks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Number three is you extraction to monetization gap.
[SPEAKER_05]: You package frameworks for sale.
[SPEAKER_05]: So how do you bridge them?
[SPEAKER_05]: And I call this the knowledge athlete system.
[SPEAKER_05]: I recently started calling myself the knowledge athlete as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: The system basically is consumption
[SPEAKER_05]: to capture, to extraction, to packaging.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, so again, to break down each step very quickly is step one is systematic capture every day.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's say you have a habit of watching YouTube videos.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's say you have a habit of watching these podcasts from Andrew Huberman, whatever you're learning from YouTube or maybe you're reading a book.
[SPEAKER_05]: So every day, 60 minutes,
[SPEAKER_05]: of reading let's take reading as an example which is non-negotiable for me reading is non-negotiable right it's part of my identity right now because that's what i've been doing for the past three months i'm a reader readers read daily but i don't just read i capture using the one one one method which we discussed in the very beginning of the space one one one goes like highlight insight
[SPEAKER_05]: action that's 1 1 1 then i store it in para right uh in my notion we discussed what para is in the beginning of the space as well so this is my daily input system um weekly extraction goes like this once a week
[SPEAKER_05]: You schedule a 60 to 90 minute extraction block.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is your protected time.
[SPEAKER_05]: No phone, airplane mode, one task.
[SPEAKER_05]: You pick one task, one concept that you've been reading about, that you've been watching about and ask yourself, if I had to teach this to 100 people tomorrow or 10 people tomorrow, what would I say?
[SPEAKER_05]: Ask yourself that.
[SPEAKER_05]: whatever you learned if you had to teach it to a hundred people what would you say how would you say it you write that down this is your weekly extraction system guys you do this for four weeks you have four frameworks okay and when you have four frameworks you extracted frameworks i mean
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how you package them, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So you see the thread that I've put in the jumbotron over here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have also made a thread yesterday.
[SPEAKER_05]: I made a thread on Saturday as well as Friday.
[SPEAKER_05]: So these threads are mini frameworks.
[SPEAKER_05]: They are my mini extractions.
[SPEAKER_05]: These spaces that I'm having are my way to retain the information that I'm learning and to apply them live.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the product modules, the modules that I'm building in my product, they are expanded extractions.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything flows from the extraction process.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the final step is the product packaging is once I have the frameworks, you should package them.
[SPEAKER_05]: So using the 100 million offers formula, who is the specific person that you package it for?
[SPEAKER_05]: What is the specific outcome?
[SPEAKER_05]: What is the outcome that you're looking for?
[SPEAKER_05]: My current outcome is make someone go from zero to $1,000.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what is the monetizable framework?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's number two.
[SPEAKER_05]: Number three is what is the specific time frame that they can go from zero to $10,000?
[SPEAKER_05]: And number four is what is the method that they can use?
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's my product in simple terms.
[SPEAKER_05]: and you have to create a system to actually do this.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not very easy.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not easy at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to build a system for yourself.
[SPEAKER_05]: Daily inputs, daily micro actions is what Atomic Habits teaches us.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to build a new habit of reading, you don't
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't say to yourself that I'm going to read an entire chapter or I'm going to read an entire book in a week.
[SPEAKER_05]: You tell yourself that I'm going to read one page today.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even lesser, I'm going to read one paragraph today.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how you start a new habit, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So you build a system for yourself to actually build this, to actually create this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Once you create systems for yourself, it gets easier and easier.
[SPEAKER_05]: For me, at this point in time, I started with 10 minutes of reading per day because I was not actively reading.
[SPEAKER_05]: But as of right now, 60 minutes of reading is non-negotiable.
[SPEAKER_05]: If I can't be reading and if I don't extract frameworks, if I don't
[SPEAKER_05]: let's say, extract and write these threads, how would I be talking about it in the spaces, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So for me, reading is non-negotiable.
[SPEAKER_05]: The 60 minutes of reading is non-negotiable.
[SPEAKER_05]: One-one-one note-taking is non-negotiable from my reading.
[SPEAKER_05]: Storing in para is non-negotiable as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: And my process is basically 90-minute extraction block, weekly, framework, document, thread writing, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: And output is basically module writing, client delivery and product building.
[SPEAKER_05]: The reason this works is because it is systematic, not motivation dependent.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not trying to create content.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm systematically extracting value from consumption.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not trying to write this thread every day.
[SPEAKER_05]: whenever I create them it is literally systematically extracting value from my consumption whatever I'm consuming either from a video that I'm watching a podcast that I'm learning from or from a book that I'm studying at this point in time I am just extracting value from it
[SPEAKER_05]: And content is just a byproduct of extraction.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been doing this for like over three months right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's part, it's kind of become a part of my identity.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can tell it with conviction that I host spaces because I've been doing this for a very, I mean, I think over a month right now, at least four spaces a week.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I can call myself a spaces host with conviction.
[SPEAKER_05]: The reason I can do that is my brain believes that
[SPEAKER_05]: through constant repetition that I've been hosting spaces so I can tell it to myself that okay I am a spaces host right and if you've been reading for quite a bit and if you're proving to yourself that and your brain you can't lie to your brain you can't lie to your subconscious brain subconscious head right you can tell other people you certain things but you can't lie to yourself you can never escape yourself
[SPEAKER_05]: So to call yourself someone as someone who's a reader with conviction, you need to believe it first.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So build these small habits, create systems for yourself.
[SPEAKER_05]: And and yeah, and you start this, guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you start?
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, quickly in like five minutes, I'm going to wrap things up is you've
[SPEAKER_05]: The action plan.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me give you guys a quick action plan here.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you've heard the problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: You've heard the solution.
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you actually start?
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's the step by step.
[SPEAKER_05]: Step one is audit your knowledge today.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or starting whenever you can, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now you should answer these questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: What books have you read in the last year?
[SPEAKER_05]: What are your notes?
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you find a specific note from, let's say, three months ago in under 30 seconds?
[SPEAKER_05]: if you can't find a note from three months ago in 30 seconds then you have to create a note capturing system for yourself okay that's number one number two is if someone had to pay you 500 to teach them something today what would you teach them right for money
[SPEAKER_05]: right if you can't answer this question immediately you are someone who has knowledge but you just can't access or package it and that is the income gap that we spoke about today right so that's the action plan guys step one step two is the implementing implement systematic capture which you can do starting tomorrow is you pick one tool
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanna say a quick hi to Julian, my friend.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for joining in.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we are ending the space right now in about two to three minutes.
[SPEAKER_05]: So step two of action plan is you pick one tool, Notion, Obsidian, Apple Notes, doesn't matter which, you create Para folders.
[SPEAKER_05]: Guys, if you're having trouble creating Para folders, feel free to reach out to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I will send across a thread which I created a couple of weeks ago regarding this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or if you want my personal kind of, my DMs are always open, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So create parafolders for yourself.
[SPEAKER_05]: For everything that you consume, use the 1-1-1 method which we discussed in earlier this space.
[SPEAKER_05]: It takes 60 seconds per chapter, guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: It takes like 60 seconds, trust me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not more than that.
[SPEAKER_05]: These 60 seconds mean you can retrieve knowledge instantly later.
[SPEAKER_05]: When someone asks you a question from Atomic Habits, you can retrieve it instantly in under a minute.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a superpower.
[SPEAKER_05]: Your notes become your inventory.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's step two.
[SPEAKER_05]: Step three is schedule your first extraction block.
[SPEAKER_05]: This week you should schedule it and stick to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pick one day this week.
[SPEAKER_05]: Block 60 to 90 minutes.
[SPEAKER_05]: No phone, no distractions.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pick one topic you've been consuming.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's say a book, a concept, a skill, a video that you've been re-watching again and again.
[SPEAKER_05]: ask yourself if i had to teach this to 10 people tomorrow what would i say write it down and that document guys that's your first framework right now that's step three and step four is the simplest part where you test your framework whatever you wrote down in your notes app right based on the one one one method and how you extracted it
[SPEAKER_05]: Write a thread about it, simple.
[SPEAKER_05]: DM five people asking, would this help you?
[SPEAKER_05]: Just test it out, get feedback.
[SPEAKER_05]: Once you get feedback, you can refine.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's how you kind of go on with this.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, guys, we're coming up on time.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's about two hours since I started this space.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's what we covered.
[SPEAKER_05]: We covered the three gaps, consumption capture gap, capture extraction gap, extraction monetization gap.
[SPEAKER_05]: The bridge to cover these gaps are systematic capturing, weekly extraction, and framework packaging.
[SPEAKER_05]: We talked about framework packaging, which is very important.
[SPEAKER_05]: Your next steps would be to audit your knowledge today, set up a para system this week, schedule extraction blocks this week, and test your framework by writing about them online, or DMing your friends and asking, would you pay for this, my friend?
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to go deeper, guys, feel free to join in my newsletter, of course.
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, take the thread that I put in in the Jumbotron, apply it to your AI and ask it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ask Chad GPT if that's what you're using.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, Chad, use this framework and help me apply it to my current project and you will get answers that you probably would not have thought about before.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, if you have not joined my newsletter, feel free to join them guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: I share framework, extraction system, book summaries, how I'm building my product, real validation updates and if this space helped, repost the thread I posted this morning.
[SPEAKER_05]: It really helps with the reach.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's close the income gap together and I want to say a quick thanks to everybody who were here since the very beginning and a quick thanks to everybody who will be listening or recording.
[SPEAKER_05]: Also to Tiger, who's been here since almost the very beginning of the space.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope this helped you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go, guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's close the income gap together.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for joining in.
[SPEAKER_05]: I will see you guys very soon.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Have a good day.
