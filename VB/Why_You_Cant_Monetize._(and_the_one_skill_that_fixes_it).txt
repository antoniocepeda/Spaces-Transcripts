[SPEAKER_02]: Hello everybody, thanks for joining in.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll just wait for one more minute to actually begin.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll wait for a couple more speakers, I mean listeners.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you guys want to join the speaker section, feel free to.
[SPEAKER_02]: to contribute to the conversation, but I'll check if my co-host would like to join.
[SPEAKER_02]: If not, we shall begin in about a minute or two.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for joining in once again.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for joining in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have just invited a couple of people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope my co-host joins.
[SPEAKER_02]: If not, that's OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll just have to take a couple of sips of water every now and then.
[SPEAKER_02]: So don't mind that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But let's begin.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to The Space.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please like and re-share The Space.
[SPEAKER_02]: That really helps in promoting The Space and also get a couple of people to join in.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Space will be about 60 to 75 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, please like and re-share The Space.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you have not joined the Startup Circle, do join in.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a cool community.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I have created a topic in terms of why you can't monetize.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've also created a thread on a similar topic, which I'm going to put it on the Jumbotron just so that you guys can have a look at it while you are listening to me speak.
[SPEAKER_02]: While I do that, I see Kevin has joined the space.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome, Kevin, to the space.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please feel free to join in the speaker panel if you want to contribute or if you want the co-host.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love to have you as a co-host as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do let me know whatever feels free for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have actually shared the co-host kind of thing to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you feel like it, you can join the co-host or, of course, just feel free to hang out, my friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyways, what's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the space.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today I am doing something different.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are going to be talking about the book and we're going to be talking about the book Deep Work by Cal Newport.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to be walking through the concepts from that book and not just the concepts, everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to be talking about the stories, the frameworks,
[SPEAKER_02]: how I'm applying those frameworks to build my $4.99 product and how you can use it starting today or even tomorrow and by the end of this space you will understand why most creators in fact most people forget creators most people are out there consuming 100 plus hours of content
[SPEAKER_02]: per month, but can't really create one thing that people, that is worth paying for, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, there's a study that says that you, an average human being consumes about 72, 72 GB of information daily, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: When you put it into computer analytics, it becomes 72 GB of information per day, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: More importantly, we'll know what to do with the information that we consume on a day-to-day basis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's get into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this book, there is a story about Carl Jung.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a quite incredible story.
[SPEAKER_02]: And let me read you the exact opening.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the opening goes like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the Swiss canton of St. Gallen,
[SPEAKER_02]: Near the northern banks of Lake Zurich is a village named Bollingen.
[SPEAKER_02]: In 1922, the psychiatrist Carl Jung chose this spot to begin building a retreat.
[SPEAKER_02]: He began with a basic two-story stone house he called the Tower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now listen to this part carefully.
[SPEAKER_02]: In my retiring room I am by myself, Carl Jung said of the space.
[SPEAKER_02]: I keep the key with me all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: No one else is allowed in there except my permission.
[SPEAKER_02]: Think about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the most influential psychiatrists in history built a stone tower in the woods.
[SPEAKER_02]: No electricity, just oil lamps and a fireplace.
[SPEAKER_02]: He would wake up at 7am, eat breakfast and then lock himself in his private office for two hours completely undistracted.
[SPEAKER_02]: Writing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And here's what's important.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was not a vacation home for him.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a retreat for him to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have another request for the speaker.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll just bring that person up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically, the context is in 1921, Carl Jung had published psychological
[SPEAKER_02]: types.
[SPEAKER_02]: This book basically said Freud is wrong about a lot of things and in the 1920s disagreeing with Sigmund Freud was a career suicide.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was a great person, Sigmund Freud.
[SPEAKER_02]: Carl Jung was in a fight, an intellectual dogfight with him.
[SPEAKER_02]: He needed to prove his ideas about analytical psychology were valid.
[SPEAKER_02]: He couldn't do that while distracted and
[SPEAKER_02]: He couldn't do that while distracted which is why he built this space in the woods with no electricity.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he built that tower, no escape work just to advance it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go with another kind of what Cal Newport writes about this is Carl Jung retreated
[SPEAKER_02]: to advance it right so he went into the woods okay people will think that it's to escape his life professional life but he went there actually to advance his professional life right uh and then the feeling of repose and renewal that i had in this tower was intense from the start right uh this is where cal introduces the concept that will change everything so what is deep work
[SPEAKER_02]: Deep work means professional activities performed in a state of distraction free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, cognitive means your brain capabilities, of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: These efforts create new value, improve your skill and are hard to replicate.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, the efforts that are done during deep work are hard to
[SPEAKER_02]: Now let me break that down as if I'm extending it to a 15 year old.
[SPEAKER_02]: So professional activities equals your actual work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not your emails, not scrolling, just your real work.
[SPEAKER_02]: What does real work stand for?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you are trying to build a business online and trying to create a product, the real work is actually building modules for that product.
[SPEAKER_02]: The real work is actually getting clients,
[SPEAKER_02]: for your service that you have to offer.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is your real work.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what professional activities mean.
[SPEAKER_02]: What does distraction free concentration mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: It means your phone is off, no notifications, no just checking anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, while you are reading a book or something, if you're reading a book, but then you also want to check your notifications on X.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll notice that you'll just check it for a couple of moments, you say a minute or something, and you want to get back to reading, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That stops your creative flow.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is distraction-free.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is the kind of distraction-free that I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, let me read the definition of deep work once again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Deep work means professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive abilities to their limit, that pushes your brain to your limit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pushing your cognitive capabilities to the limit is very hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your brain hurts.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're thinking deeply.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these efforts actually create new value, improve your skill and are hard to replicate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Deep work skills are hard to replicate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what does creating new value mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Creating new value means you make something that probably does not exist very often or is not created by many people.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is creating new value means.
[SPEAKER_02]: Improve your skill means, of course, you get better at your craft.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you are writing in a cabin in the woods and only focused on writing, you get better at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you have distractions while you're writing, you don't get better at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK. And of course, deep work skills are hard to replicate.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why it's valuable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not everyone can do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why it's valuable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Carol Newport said something beautiful and really powerful here is
[SPEAKER_02]: Deep work is necessary to wring every last drop of value out of your current intellectual capacity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay read that again.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to read that again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Deep work is necessary to wring every last drop of value out of your current intellectual capacity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every last drop.
[SPEAKER_02]: you're not even close to your full capacity guys none of us are in fact there's a research that is done that we barely use about six to eight percent of our brain's capabilities throughout our lives six to eight percent of our brain's capabilities throughout our lives and in this distracted age of AI we are not even getting close to those eight percent of using our brain because every time we sit down to work
[SPEAKER_02]: If we are working at 95, we are always on social media.
[SPEAKER_02]: While we are working, we are probably on Netflix.
[SPEAKER_02]: While we are working, who knows, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: We are just distracted all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are not getting into the aspect of deep work at all, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of us aren't, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the 1900s, Carl Jung had this problem where he was distracted with radio by his family every single time.
[SPEAKER_02]: which is why he retreated to the woods alone, literally to the woods alone, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And Carl Jung was not alone in doing some things like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Major great people, a lot of great people did this.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, Michael did Montaigne.
[SPEAKER_02]: He wrote essays in a private library in the southern tower of his French chateau.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mark Twain, I think a lot of people know Mark Twain, you can just google him, wrote Tom Sawyer in a shed so far from the main house his family had to blow a horn to call him for lunch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, back then there was no phone.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he used to go so far away from his house because he was getting distracted at his house that his family had to blow a horn to call him for his meals.
[SPEAKER_02]: Woody Allen is someone who is quite recent.
[SPEAKER_02]: He did 44 films in 44 years between 1970s to 2013.
[SPEAKER_02]: okay back then computers were there right he never owned a computer but even until 2013 he never owned a computer he wrote everything on a manual typewriter woody allen because he knew that when he gets a computer he's going to get distracted with emails so on and so forth right and jk rowling guys the one who owns the one who wrote down harry potter jk rowling was not on social media while writing harry potter
[SPEAKER_02]: The first real tweet that JK Rowling had was saying that on a social media platform saying that this is the real me, but you won't be hearing from me often as I am afraid as pen and paper is my priority.
[SPEAKER_02]: She wrote that one tweet for like and then she disappeared for about years.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, that was JK Rowling.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Bill Gates did think weeks twice a year, locked himself in a lakeside cottage just to read and think.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bill Gates.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all the great people out there knew the advantage of getting deep work done.
[SPEAKER_02]: And technology these days is driving us away from doing the deep work.
[SPEAKER_02]: The more and more deep work gets scarce, the more valuable deep work becomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: People like Mark Twain, JK Rowling, Woody Allen, Bill Gates, these people didn't stumble into greatness.
[SPEAKER_02]: They systematically removed distraction from their lives and went in deep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, we spoke about what deep work means, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me repeat the definition of deep work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Deep work is the professional activities that you perform in a state of distraction free concentration that push your brain abilities to their limit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, these efforts create new value, improve your skill and are hard to replicate.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is deep work.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, what is shallow work?
[SPEAKER_02]: Shallow work is something that can be defined as non-cognitively demanding tasks performed while distracted.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't create new value and they are easy to replicate and they don't improve your skills, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, working while commenting on X.
[SPEAKER_02]: Writing in your notebook while commenting on X.
[SPEAKER_02]: Attending, let's say, meetings while you are also on your phone responding to a message.
[SPEAKER_02]: Responding to emails.
[SPEAKER_02]: Scrolling social media.
[SPEAKER_02]: Researching, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm putting this in quotes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Researching.
[SPEAKER_02]: Researching is another form of procrastinating, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Organizing your notes for the 10th time.
[SPEAKER_02]: watching another tutorial these can be termed as shallow work they are non-cognitively demanding tasks performed while distracted they don't create new value they are easy to replicate they don't improve your skills guys if they are easy to replicate then anybody on this planet can do it which means your skills are not valuable enough which means you are not valuable enough right so
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to go into this mode of deep work to hone your skills.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're a writer, you need to get into a deep work state every single day to hone your craft.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see nominators joined the space.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome, my friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: Feel free to jump onto the speaker section if you feel the need to contribute or to ask any kind of questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And guys, any questions, feel free to drop in the purple pill.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: While I am speaking on the space, I'm also looking at the purple pill and checking if there are any questions being asked.
[SPEAKER_02]: So feel free.
[SPEAKER_02]: People on the speaker panel, Johnson and Jethro, if you have anything to contribute, please feel free to raise your hand whenever you feel the need and we can jump into your points.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we spoke about what shallow work is, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Shallow work is simply non-cognitively demanding tasks performed while distracted.
[SPEAKER_02]: And guys, here's the problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most knowledge workers, when I say knowledge workers, I mean creators.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I mean creators, I mean artists, people who write, people who think, people who have their own craft.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are knowledge workers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to be using the term knowledge workers a lot here because I am one and we all are striving to be knowledge workers.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why we are here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So most knowledge workers have completely lost the ability to go deep.
[SPEAKER_02]: so let me tell you a story about Jason Ben and it is the story of Jason Ben is mentioned in the in the book Deep Work where Jason Ben is actually a finance guy he had a corporate job and he wanted to learn programming to change careers right but he had a problem so
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me read you this quote from the book directly is I was always getting from Jason Ben, by the way, Jason Ben said that I was always getting on the Internet and checking my email.
[SPEAKER_02]: I couldn't stop myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a compulsion.
[SPEAKER_02]: To check his email was a compulsion for Jason Ben.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, his boss once asked him to write a business plan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was a good opportunity to shine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jason decided to read five business plans to learn the format, but he couldn't focus.
[SPEAKER_02]: He himself admits that there were days during this period when I've spent almost every minute, in fact 98% of my time, surfing the internet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the business plan that his boss asked never got done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's because he was distracted most of the time checking, checking, checking the Internet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when Jason quit to learn programming, he knew he had to fix this.
[SPEAKER_02]: His method was pretty extreme, though.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said that he locked himself in a room with no computer, just textbooks, notecards and a highlighter.
[SPEAKER_02]: He locked himself in a room with no computer, just textbooks, note cards and a highlighter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now at first this was hard, but over time he got 5 plus hours per day of deep work done and he was able to read 18 books on programming.
[SPEAKER_02]: When he shut himself down in a room with no computer and no internet,
[SPEAKER_02]: and just textbooks and notebooks.
[SPEAKER_02]: He managed to read 18 books on programming.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then they had a dev boot camp.
[SPEAKER_02]: He crushed it in the dev boot camp, which a Princeton PhD called the hardest thing I've ever done in my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty hard to crush a dev boot camp.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you guys have heard of the language DevOps, it's pretty hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he crushed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jason went from someone who can't focus for 10 minutes to deep work machine in two months.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's because he trained his mind by locking himself in a room without computer, without internet and just books.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was hard at first, but then in two months he was able to do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he went from someone
[SPEAKER_02]: who can't focus for 10 minutes to deep working machine in two months and he crushed the dev boot camp.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now let's jump into what a deep work hypothesis means.
[SPEAKER_02]: The deep work hypothesis means the ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly rare at exactly the same time it's becoming increasingly valuable in our economy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as a consequence, the few who cultivate the skill and then make it to the core of their working life will thrive.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is taken directly from the book, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to read it again.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what the Deep Work Hypothesis is.
[SPEAKER_02]: The ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly rare at exactly the same time it is becoming increasingly valuable in our economy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as a consequence, the few who cultivate the habit of deep work and then make it the core of their working life
[SPEAKER_02]: are the ones who will succeed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now let me explain why this matters right now in 2025.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone is distracted, notifications every five minutes, social media, DMs, Slack, emails, and you want to check your X notifications every now and then.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty sure everybody over here are
[SPEAKER_02]: are pretty keen on replying to replying to comments wanting to be the reply guy etc right so everybody is distracted and that is why the concept of deep work is getting more and more valuable the average knowledge worker can barely focus for 10 minutes straight these days 10 minutes
[SPEAKER_02]: If we can't focus for 10 minutes, how do we plan on creating something valuable?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we plan on creating an offer of $500 of $2,500 that people would want to buy from you if you're not able to focus for 10 minutes, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why deep work is getting more and more valuable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in an information economy, the people who can think deeply and create complex things are the ones who will win.
[SPEAKER_02]: The people who can only do shallow work will get replaced.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guys, think about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, AI is going to replace any task that is repetitive,
[SPEAKER_02]: in by 2027 any repetitive task is going to be replaced if you are in the corporate environment so basically any entry-level job and even a senior level job people will get replaced by 2027 right because usually the entry-level folks in a corporate environment are doing the tasks that are pretty repetitive and like I said any repetitive task can be replaced by AI so
[SPEAKER_02]: The ability to focus for a period of 90 minutes to two hours at least for a day is getting increasingly and increasingly more important.
[SPEAKER_02]: So guys, if you can go deep when everyone else is distracted, you have a massive competitive advantage.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the book, Cal Newport uses these examples.
[SPEAKER_02]: example of nate silver who built election forecasting models right deep work created so much value that espn and abc fought over him um and several other examples but uh but yeah guys if you can go deep when everyone else is distracted you have a massive competitive advantage right now
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about, since there are no questions as of right now, I'm going to move on into how I'm applying this in my day-to-day life and how I'm applying this to build my $499 product.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I realized something that I've been making the same mistake Jason Ben made, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, he used to get distracted.
[SPEAKER_02]: while working, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: When I'm reading my books, I used to get distracted through X notifications.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to check my X every now and then and not really focus, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Not really doing the deep work that this book talks about.
[SPEAKER_02]: And look, guys,
[SPEAKER_02]: When you can't do the deep work, when you're constantly checking your emails, for example, when I'm reading my book and if I'm not able to completely focus onto it, I will not be able to come up with aha moments.
[SPEAKER_02]: They call it the aha moments.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I keep checking my emails or checking my notifications every five minutes that I'm reading the book, I will not be able to imagine things in my head.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I actually have two clients I'm working with at this point in time.
[SPEAKER_02]: My job is to help them extract frameworks from their knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: But here's the thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I cannot help them think clearly if my mind is distracted.
[SPEAKER_02]: framework extraction from my clients requires my deep focus and not just theirs, but it requires my deep focus.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's my deep work system that I have followed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically, when I wake up, I am training my mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm 31 years old now.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for the past 30 years of my life, I've been living in this distraction filled world, which means I have been on my phone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have been I also have eight years of corporate experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have worked in a corporate environment as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been I've been distracted.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: My mind has been racing at 100 miles per hour for a very long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I want to reduce the speed of my mind from 100 miles per hour to maybe 10 miles per hour, 10 kilometers an hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do I do this?
[SPEAKER_02]: It can't be done overnight.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how I'm training my mind to instead of being running at 100 miles per hour to 10 miles is I wake up when I wake up the first two to three hours, no phone whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_02]: No phone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I tried to meditate for a couple of days.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is it is helpful, but it is not as easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I am going halfway.
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead of meditating, I'm focusing on my breath.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do I focus on my breath is through movement.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You exercise when you're on a run.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't be thinking a hundred thoughts when you are running.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't be thinking a hundred thoughts when you are lifting weights.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So exercise is a great way to slow down your thoughts and slow down the slow down the rate at which your mind is moving.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And your mind is everybody's mind these days is moving at 100 miles per hour because of the distractions of the Internet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first two hours completely focused on my breath.
[SPEAKER_02]: No phone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trying to slow down the equilibrium of my brain.
[SPEAKER_02]: by let's say 100 miles an hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've been successfully doing this for close to 70 days now.
[SPEAKER_02]: 70 days, no phone for the first two hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if it was 100 miles per hour 70 days ago, I think I brought the equilibrium state of my brain from 100 to at least 60 or 50.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still have a long way to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to get it down to 10 miles an hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to have thoughts in the morning, but it is difficult not to have thoughts you want to have.
[SPEAKER_02]: They say stress is created when you have a lot of thoughts, when you have a lot of open loops, which are which have to be closed, but are not closed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also your creative energy is lost when you have when you are deciding things in the morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the more things you are deciding in your head in the morning, the more brain energy you are using up then and the more and the lesser brain energy you will have when you actually need to do any kind of creative work.
[SPEAKER_02]: So which is why people say that your day morning starts the night before.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is absolutely true, which is why people ask you to
[SPEAKER_02]: plan your morning the night before decide the things that you are going to be doing the night before because if you decide what you're going to do in the morning that particular morning you're using up brain energy guys
[SPEAKER_02]: And the more brain energy you utilize, the lesser brain energy you will have for actual deep work, which can be reading, which can be writing, which can be creating that module, which can be perhaps even closing that deal with your client, which you have at the end of the day or between the day, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, that is my morning system at this point in time.
[SPEAKER_02]: No phones, slowing down the rate at which my brain is moving and I am halfway there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you have to do some deep work, you have to block 60 to 90 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't say block more than 90 minutes because nobody can really work after.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody can really use their creative juices at the rate at which they use at maximum potential after 90 minutes of continuous work.
[SPEAKER_02]: So block about 60 to 90 minutes maximum.
[SPEAKER_02]: And after 90 minutes, take a break of about 15 minutes to 20 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Andrew Huberman, guys, if you guys are following him,
[SPEAKER_02]: He says you have to take a break of 15 minutes and in those 15 minutes you can do anything that is non-work related.
[SPEAKER_02]: What can be non-work related?
[SPEAKER_02]: It can be again doing some movement, so doing some push-ups, doing some squats, maybe some breath work, maybe you can go and talk to your family.
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking to your family or speaking to your loved ones do release a hormone called oxytocin which is important for creative energy by the way so you can speak to your loved ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do anything in those 15 to 20 minutes after 90 minutes that is non-work related to get back in the flow of working once again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rehearsed rest that you guys take after 90 minutes is also important for you to get actual work done during your deep work sessions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And guys, I have been 70 days into this process now, and I have kind of like created a frame, a framework in which when I'm in my deep work block,
[SPEAKER_02]: there is kind of no switching at all no checking
[SPEAKER_02]: Emails, definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have stopped checking my notifications from X. I have a fixed time block that I check my notifications and that I respond to my engagements.
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand the importance of networking on X. I'm pretty sure everybody understands the importance of networking and engagement on X.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you are doing it every hour of every day,
[SPEAKER_02]: Then when are you actually getting some real work done?
[SPEAKER_02]: That is my question.
[SPEAKER_02]: When are you getting the work done?
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to set aside time for these shallow work that needs to be done.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I say shallow work, I mean the work that does not require any cognitive ability.
[SPEAKER_02]: You responding to engagements don't really need that much brain energy.
[SPEAKER_02]: right so you can schedule one or two hours in the evening after you've done your heavy lifting of the day to actually engage right that's why you see a lot of knowledge workers successful knowledge workers guys if you go read through their newsletters they will always talk about how they get deep work done at the beginning of the day right um and then get some exercise done and then they start their actual client work
[SPEAKER_02]: or any kind of meetings they have, or any checking their emails in the afternoon after they have had their lunch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because lunch is a big factor as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have a full belly, you will not be able to concentrate on your work as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, so that was a long tangent that I took.
[SPEAKER_02]: But let's talk about what, let's go step back into the book.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is exactly what Cal talks about, by the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: He says three to four hours a day, five days a week of uninterrupted and carefully directed concentration can produce a lot of valuable output.
[SPEAKER_02]: The guy went on Cal Newport, guys, he he has published four books.
[SPEAKER_02]: He has earned a Ph.D.
[SPEAKER_02]: and he rarely works past 5 or 6 p.m. he has two kids so he has successfully backed up what he says he clearly says three to four hours a day of uninterrupted and carefully directed concentration
[SPEAKER_02]: can produce a lot of output.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can't really go more than two to three deep work sessions in a day, by the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to say a quick hi to Timo, who joined the space after I don't know how many weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nice to have you here, Timo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please feel free to join the speaker section if you want to contribute.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are talking about deep work.
[SPEAKER_02]: But let's talk about what Cal Newport was saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cal Newport was saying three to four hours a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to go eight hours a day or nine hours a day of complete deep work guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Three to four hours, two to three deep working sessions, two to three 90 minute sessions, more than enough in a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do it for a period of two to three months.
[SPEAKER_02]: You will have done some substantial work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Cal Newport backs it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: He has two kids.
[SPEAKER_02]: He rarely ever works after five to six p.m.
[SPEAKER_02]: He has published four books and he has earned a PhD as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: How?
[SPEAKER_02]: Through deep work blocks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I'm not gonna lie guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is pretty hard for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have been pretty much wired through the 30 years of my life to checking my notifications.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do get FOMO.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do want to see who has responded to my thread, who has responded to my posts.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do want to check my DMs every now and then as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do get FOMO, but that's the exact problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every time I
[SPEAKER_02]: Every time I context switch, I leave attention residue on the previous task.
[SPEAKER_02]: My brain can't fully focus on the new thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why I'm doing what Carl Jung did, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Carl Jung went into the woods and he built a house, no electricity and only fire and his books, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing exactly that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I reside in Bangalore, I'm from India, but I've moved away from my hometown and I'm residing currently in Chennai for a period of 15 days now because I wanted to step away from distractions for a period of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he went into the woods, I have moved cities because I know that if I'm in the city,
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I get any kind of, let's say, if I feel the need to meet my friend or call somebody or ask them to meet me or whatever, I can just call my, call that person up and he or she is, I can meet them in a matter of one hour, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But I can't do that and get distracted if I'm in another town, so I'm exactly doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also have deep working sessions.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a system created for myself where my mornings.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a morning block so 9am to 11am I'm only reading 6am to 8am I'm only moving my body.
[SPEAKER_02]: And 12 p.m to 1.30 or 2 p.m I am writing and doing my client stuff and my spaces right now it's 4 p.m my spaces I usually start after I've done my deep work sessions right of the day because for me speaking is non-cognitive
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't take up much of my brain energy, so it's kind of like a shallow work as Cal Newport would talk about it, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not something that requires deep work for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I speak for a period of 60 to 90 minutes, then to move back into deep work status is pretty hard for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It may be different for other people, but for me, I realized this about myself through trial and error and I realized that I need to be doing my spaces at this particular time of my day because if I do it earlier in the day, I will not be able to get much deep work done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yesterday I wrote one module of my product, 4500 words, identity and mindset.
[SPEAKER_02]: I posted about it as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did it in one 90 minute deep work block.
[SPEAKER_02]: Phone off, just me, Claude, my AI that I'm using.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not using GPT anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: and just thinking through the frameworks if I had to write that while checking X every 10 minutes it would have taken half a day or even two days who knows and been half as good right that is the power of depth and now let's talk about how you can apply this guys we've been speaking about the book but let's talk about how you can apply this you're probably thinking that sounds great Vaibhav but I don't have 90 minutes
[SPEAKER_02]: every single day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have three deep work sessions that I can have every single day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a nine to five job.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have kids.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have responsibilities.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's what Cal Newport says.
[SPEAKER_02]: He says you don't need to move into the woods like what Carl Young did.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't need any fancy tools.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just need the ability
[SPEAKER_02]: to concentrate without distractions that's pretty much it so you can try this guys tomorrow or today block 60 to 90 minutes maybe after your 9 to 5 job if you work a 9 to 5 or before your your 9 to 5 job which is why the people who work wake up at 5 a.m get a lot of shit done simply because the time between 5 a.m to 7 a.m is like the time where
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody is really awake.
[SPEAKER_02]: No notifications come to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can get a lot of work done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why people who wake up at 5 a.m. continuously for a period of one, two, three years, you can see transformation in them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they have had one, two, three years of continuous deep work sessions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you just have to
[SPEAKER_02]: gain the ability to concentrate without distractions.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to block 60 to 90 minutes on your calendar, not free time, but actual blocked time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Treat it like a meeting you cannot miss and that you have to pay full attention to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And pick one task, not three tasks,
[SPEAKER_02]: pick one task to do in that 90 60 to 90 minutes so that one task can be perhaps write one concept clearly enough to teach it right or it could be writing one thread on x or it could be writing one module for your product or it could be writing or it could be reading one chapter of a book right
[SPEAKER_02]: or just creating one piece of content worth saving.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guys, if you can't, if you have not created content and you have not understood it enough to actually teach it or talk to a friend about it, then you have not really created that content.
[SPEAKER_02]: So block 60 to 90 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pick one task.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's step two.
[SPEAKER_02]: Step three would be to remove all distractions.
[SPEAKER_02]: How would you remove all distractions?
[SPEAKER_02]: Simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lock yourself in a room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put your phone on airplane mode.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not just on silent mode, airplane mode.
[SPEAKER_02]: close every tab on your computer except what you need so if you want to write for 60 minutes apart from your writing tool close every tab that you close every other tab x facebook google and put your phone on airplane mode for crying out loud that and don't succumb to your urges
[SPEAKER_02]: of let me just check one let me just get one check on my notifications that one check guys derails you a lot uh it is said in research that it takes you about um so if you get distracted for a period of five minutes through x or through notifications that you want to check to get back into focus mode actually requires 13 minutes
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you have 60 minutes of work block that you have set for yourself and you check for a period of two minutes and it takes you 13 minutes to get back, I mean, you wasted a lot of time out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have Bob who's requested to come on the speaker panel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bob, it's been a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: Firstly, I have not seen Bob on X for quite some time, but secondly, wonderful to have you here, Bob.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love to hear your take on this subject.
[SPEAKER_02]: And on the deep work topic, feel free to contribute whenever you feel like.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, so don't succumb to this thought that I will just one quick check on my notifications.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do not.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is step three.
[SPEAKER_02]: Remove all distractions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Step four would be to actually doing the work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: and here's the thing guys the first 20 minutes will suck your brain will fight you you will want to check your phone you will want to check your emails you'll think of 10 urgent things you need to do and that's normal right think of it like this when you sit down to meditate right meditate
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you get into the state of thoughtlessness right away?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do you get a rush of thoughts and then do you fight it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the exact same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've been used to checking your phone every three to five minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've been used to pulling it out of your pocket and reply on X.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be hard for the first 20 minutes, but you have to push through.
[SPEAKER_02]: right and that's normal your brain telling you to check your phone it is normal once you push through it around minute 25 23 something will actually shift you drop into the deep work state time actually disappears and the work actually starts flowing
[SPEAKER_02]: you get into the flow state that a lot of people talk about.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think writers can relate to a lot about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: People who write newsletters, people who journal in the mornings, people who even run in the mornings, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: They get this runner's high as such, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that is what the flow state is all about.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is the deep work state.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to quickly move into Bob and then we'll move into Johnson.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bob, it's been a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, what's up, Vibe?
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks so much for having me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I get a quick mic check?
[SPEAKER_05]: Am I sounding good?
[SPEAKER_05]: Am I clear and loud and in the space to be?
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, what's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_05]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope you're having a great day.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted to pick up on a lot of what you've been saying.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the things about distractions for me are an absolute killer.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I can I can hyper focus and do something, but I cannot deal with the distractions.
[SPEAKER_05]: I do not have notifications enabled for pretty much everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: Only a couple of things can get through to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's for emergencies.
[SPEAKER_05]: I do not open my email client and check every email that comes in because I have maybe 10 different email accounts and I get hundreds of emails, you know, not even
[SPEAKER_05]: If I look in the spam folder, I get thousands of emails like in in hours.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's no chance if I was consuming every message and every email and every piece of content, I'd never get anything done.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's twice as difficult for me because I'm that particular neuro
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe I'm neurodivergent.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not 100% sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't been diagnosed.
[SPEAKER_05]: But when I am distracted, even just by somebody saying, Hey, what's up?
[SPEAKER_05]: Would you like a cup of tea?
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm in that deep focus state, it takes me, they may have just interrupted me for two minutes, it takes me at least 10 times that.
[SPEAKER_05]: to get back to where I was and actually continue doing the thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I will lose 10 hours if I'm hyper focused building something.
[SPEAKER_05]: It takes me three months.
[SPEAKER_05]: I will spend 12 hours a day for those three months in hyper focus, lockdown, no distractions.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's how I'm able to build something from start to finish with no other help.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't think that's how most people work.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very, very difficult vibe.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's my comment on distractions, making sure you're focused.
[SPEAKER_05]: I am interested in the topic.
[SPEAKER_05]: You hooked me with the why you can't monetize and the one thing that fixes it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's it from me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Bob, for your perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's nice to know that there is a fellow human being who relates to exactly how I feel when somebody distracts me with just a cup of tea, takes me
[SPEAKER_02]: 10 times the amount to get back into the focus and actually it's a real thing guys it actually takes according to research from this book it actually takes 13 minutes to get back to where you were if you get distracted for even like a minute it takes you 13 minutes and it seems like you are someone who gets a lot of work done guys it does doesn't it seem like bob bob is someone who gets a lot of shit done that's because he has
[SPEAKER_02]: set a system for himself that allows him to work in the deep state without distractions.
[SPEAKER_02]: For me it's difficult as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: My phone's on DND throughout the day except for my family.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's throughout the day it's on DND but still I get sometimes let's say the weekend comes in and then I want to call up a friend right and then that one that one day of the weekend can ruin let's say two to three next days right so
[SPEAKER_02]: which is why I have moved town right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've actually switched from where I actually stay and I've actually moved town to a place called Chennai in India and I'm actually paying
[SPEAKER_02]: paying an Airbnb to be staying here every single day because that's the importance I've put to get some deep work done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because even right now, if I want to call anybody, there's no way I can meet them, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm forced to concentrate and to do my deep work.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you, Bob, for your perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: I totally relate to what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to move to Johnson, who had his hand up as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Johnson, what do you have to speak about this topic, my friend?
[SPEAKER_02]: And thanks for joining The Space.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you hear me clearly?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we can hear you loud and clear, my friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so nice to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's one of my first time here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Option of the space, you know, I just saw why you can't monetize and the one that fixes it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, OK, let me just.
[SPEAKER_01]: Going on, and well, it's a lot of value from what you've learned so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just have a question based on what you were saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm a developer, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And speaking of living or going to the woods to do those things, you know, as a developer, you need a lot of things when it comes to internet connection, especially when you're working with a team whereby you always need that constant
[SPEAKER_01]: communication, discussion, and you know, you're using the same, for example, x space, maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: Trello etc like that, you know, it boils down to the fact that you can't, um, escape destruction a hundred percent, even if you want to escape it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, maybe you get my point, but I mean, even if you want to escape destruction, like a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the question is, uh, of course I know this is more of a writer set up now based on your explanations, but if we want to, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: go from the programmer's perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe there should be one or two persons here who is also into programming.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we want to go into from the programmer's perspective, how do you think the deep work is going to work in that light?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is my question clear or should I explain further?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I totally get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are saying that it's quite hard to be completely 100 percent distracted.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and, um, yeah, you are, you are a developer, so you are on your system all the time, which means, um, you also, um, get the tendency to probably check your notifications, check your email, so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, but here's the thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, Pavel Durov.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know who he is?
[SPEAKER_02]: He is the CEO of Telegram.
[SPEAKER_02]: This guy, uh, and I mean,
[SPEAKER_02]: he was a developer as well, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a tech expert.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the guy, if you read his frameworks and the way he kept himself away from distractions, I think it'll be really inspiring for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what he did is he actually kept himself in a room, did not have a social media account for a very long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: did not have any kind of let's say whatsapp or anything installed because whatsapp did come first right until he built the telegram account and he was one of the greatest developers to ever walk on the planet
[SPEAKER_02]: He did not succumb to distractions.
[SPEAKER_02]: He created a system for himself and he maintained his body.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you look at his physique right now, he's 41 something years old right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you look at his physique, he's someone who does 500 pushups every single day.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's someone who does 500 squats every single day, every single morning, apart from the weights that he lifts.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he's a strong believer of somebody who says strong body equals to strong mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, first things first, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have been primed throughout our entire lives to be distracted, even if you're someone who drives through traffic, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Your emotions are going on a spiral up and down, up and down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody blocks your way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody else is being ridiculous, but then your emotions go up, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Up and down.
[SPEAKER_02]: So emotional regulation, even through traffic, we are primed
[SPEAKER_02]: We are wired these days to be emotionally regulated up and down, which does not create a calm state, which makes it difficult to create a calm state.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me put it that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the best way to create a calm state is, I would say, Johnson, for you to dive into movement first thing in the morning, follow Pavel Durov's strategy of strong body equals strong mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is number one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Number two is anybody who has never meditated in their lives, if you ask them to meditate on day one, they will not be able to sit down without opening their eyes for a period, let's say, 15 minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if they force themselves in about a month or two, they will be able to.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would want to say, Johnson, is firstly, is to take out that belief.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take out that belief that you think that being distracted is common, being distracted is what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I never used to think that I will keep my phone on DND at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, for 70 days straight, my phone's always on DND, even right now, except for calls from my mom and dad and my wife.
[SPEAKER_02]: But apart from that, it's on DND every single time, unless I choose to switch on WhatsApp.
[SPEAKER_02]: I choose.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is point number one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Strong mind, strong body.
[SPEAKER_02]: Point number two is, of course, take out that limiting belief.
[SPEAKER_02]: Point number three, what I would like to say,
[SPEAKER_02]: is keep one to two hours per day every single day for distractions or for a period of worry so if you want to worry about certain things set a time for yourself during the day to worry rest of the time you do your work
[SPEAKER_02]: Set aside a time to worry and during your worrying time you can probably get distracted as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm keen on hearing what Bob has to say for this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So over to you, Bob.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love it, Bob.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I love the idea of setting aside a time to think and plan and be concerned about what you're doing next.
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe the word worry.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, I set aside that time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Plan, execute, make lists and then focus on what you've got to do next.
[SPEAKER_05]: The next step
[SPEAKER_05]: that you have to achieve in order to get closer to your goal.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And as far as having the thing in Do Not Disturb, I think I've got you beat.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not that it's a competition, but I think my phone's been in Do Not Disturb since I first
[SPEAKER_05]: got a smartphone.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when I first got a iPhone, I actually jailbroke the phone so I could have a whitelist, blacklist SMS filter in the device so I wouldn't get messages from anybody unless I allowed them to send me a message.
[SPEAKER_05]: But these are really, really important things to consider.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to get stuff done,
[SPEAKER_05]: you've got to be able to focus and in order to be able to focus you can't be thinking about everything all of the time you've got to be able to split those things up and allocate the time to think.
[SPEAKER_05]: to be concerned about what you need to do next to plan.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then once you've got that list of things to do, your brain will do its magic if you let it do its magic, because that's what it does.
[SPEAKER_05]: It processes, finds solutions for you, even if you sleep.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I've been in hyper-focus three months coding, and I sleep, but I code at my desk in my sleep, like dreaming that I'm at my desk.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when I wake up, I found the solution.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the key is to allow your mind to do its job.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: A hundred percent, Bob.
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, yes, you do have me beat.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that is something.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is I mean, you've been having your phone on DND ever since you got your smartphone.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is quite incredible to hear, by the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is only in the past three months that I have decided to put my phone on DND because I was I decided and
[SPEAKER_02]: And I got married, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's high time right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to get things done.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why I'm like, dude, there's no other thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's nothing else that's important for you at this point in time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, that's the kind of push that I kind of needed to put my phone on DND finally.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's been on DND ever since.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a great story to hear Bob.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd love to ask you, what is it that you're focusing on at the moment?
[SPEAKER_05]: What are your goals currently?
[SPEAKER_05]: How are you going to get there?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually building a product which I'm planning to launch in December.
[SPEAKER_02]: before the start of next year for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this product is my current, let's say, high ticket product.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I'm launching my product.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm busy on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my first project.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my current project.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, after this will be my other projects back to back.
[SPEAKER_05]: let's go i wish i had that focus at the moment i'm still a little bit all over the place but i'll get there in my own time yeah i mean i got this push so i created a let's say a free lead magnet in october
[SPEAKER_02]: the end of September and I decided, OK, this is just the baseline.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I'm and I'm since I'm getting newsletter subscriptions, since my lead lead man is getting subscriptions, I need to create a full fledged business while I also work part time during the evenings, which kind of pays my bills.
[SPEAKER_02]: At this point in time, I would want to own my time completely, which is why I want to build a product of my choice and
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, work on the times that I choose.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, one more great push for me is I want to be available for my future kids every single moment of their, let's say, until they reach their adult life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every single moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to be distracted by meetings.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to get calls from someone else.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to be
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to be in control of my time and in control of what I do with my time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the motivation that is driving me to do the things that I'm doing at this point in time.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think one of the mistakes I made during my time creating a business, so I started my business 20 years ago, and I also had some sort of lead magnet.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the biggest mistake that I've made, I think, not just in business, but perhaps in my lifetime, is not being able to effectively communicate.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what I've been working on for five years, not just effectively communicating my needs, my wants and desires,
[SPEAKER_05]: I was very good at understanding other people's wants, needs, and desires.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I never, in terms of business, I never built myself a system to keep track of everybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: So having those lead magnets, having people subscribe to you, being able to own that list and communicate effectively with everybody is, I think, one step closer.
[SPEAKER_05]: So a lead magnet can be anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: For me, it was
[SPEAKER_05]: a need, a desire by somebody fulfilled by a simple form and a report.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would produce a report for them.
[SPEAKER_05]: It gave me the information.
[SPEAKER_05]: It set me up when I sent them the report.
[SPEAKER_05]: It set me up as an expert in the field, which made talking with them when I gave them a phone call, it made talking with them already advantageous because I'm already known to them.
[SPEAKER_05]: But one thing I should have done and would like to be able to do better is be in contact and communication with those leads, with those people, even in friends and social settings.
[SPEAKER_05]: I struggle with that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So anybody here, if you're looking to get started with lead magnets, email lists, collecting people's contact details, even on social media,
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to know that those skills are very, very important.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those social skills, being able to frame what you need, what your desires are, as well as understand them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Without it, you'll maybe do 10 years of work and you'll build something, but it won't sustain itself.
[SPEAKER_05]: without building some kind of system to communicate with everybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you got a particular platform?
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you using a custom CRM, Microsoft Dynamics?
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you using something like SugarCRM?
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you doing something a little bit more simple, building a custom solution?
[SPEAKER_05]: Or are you just using maybe Substack?
[SPEAKER_05]: Substack, I think, is a great place to collect people's emails
[SPEAKER_05]: in communication?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, thanks for the question, Bob.
[SPEAKER_02]: So at this point in time, I'm using Yes Substack as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually active on all the platforms, pretty much all the big platforms except TikTok because TikTok is banned in India.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm on YouTube, I'm on Instagram, I'm on LinkedIn, I'm on X. X is where I do most of my work.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm mainly on X. I have a VA for myself that I've been fortunate enough to hire.
[SPEAKER_02]: to work on my other platforms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hulu repurposes my content from X and puts it on the other platforms, so Substack as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in terms of my newsletters, yes, I get some subscribers from Substack, but it's mainly through Beehive.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you check the link on my bio, that's my Beehive, it's made through Beehive, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You subscribe over there, it comes into my Beehive subscriptions, and that's pretty much it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, so bhev is the simple thing that I'm using, which I would recommend everybody to use.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like you said, Bob, very important to have a distribution system, because guys, if you're not collecting emails, by the way, that's a huge mistake, a very big mistake, because if you think follower count matters on X, you're gravely mistaken, my guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: the only thing that matters really is your subscribers your subscribers are the followers that you own because your x account your youtube account instagram account instagram may just get may just shut down tomorrow x may just shut down tomorrow
[SPEAKER_02]: right away you your account may get banned because you've been reported by 100 people for some strange reason maybe you dropped a comment and you got reported by 100 people you never know what will happen to your accounts but your subscribers are there with you forever and they are your real audience and that is what you must nurture my friends and that is what you should definitely look for look to build
[SPEAKER_02]: Because follow count doesn't mean anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's your subscriptions, subscribers that mean everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are your real audience.
[SPEAKER_02]: And thanks for bringing this up, Bob.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, Beehive is a great platform to collect subscribers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Easier platform would be Substack as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Substack also is an algorithm-based
[SPEAKER_05]: um based platform you have to uh kind of get used to it so if you're someone who works on x it's a different algorithm i think timo will be able to talk further on it um but yeah guys let's jump it's about paid uh paid and and owned uh i think those are the three categories when i wrote an article about this uh some years ago and the different algorithms and your follow account you know
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't mean you can't produce content that is seen by a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_05]: With these 4U algorithms like on TikTok, you don't have to have followers in order for something to blow up and be seen.
[SPEAKER_05]: The follower count really doesn't mean too much in that context.
[SPEAKER_05]: However, in the social aspect, in the social cloud, when you see somebody who has hundreds of thousands or millions of followers, you might pay a little bit more attention to them.
[SPEAKER_05]: But absolutely, and definitely on TikTok, you can have tiny accounts that have viral videos blow up.
[SPEAKER_05]: It really just depends on what you're creating and who you're creating it for.
[SPEAKER_02]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like to add a side note to that is you can find a lot of people with a lot of followers.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, there's this one person with 50,000 followers on X.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you see the same person on LinkedIn, he's actually looking for a job.
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone with 50,000 followers who has not built an email list, who has not built a business, and then now moving back to working a nine to five.
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes you wonder, that makes you think, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: In my eyes, of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: The criteria that I would, in fact, I would put in terms of who to pay more attention to, like you said, Bob, would not necessarily be in terms of followers, but would necessarily mean in terms of impressions.
[SPEAKER_02]: If a single post from this person
[SPEAKER_02]: who has 500 followers can get about 10,000 impressions.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's something he's doing right.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's something that he's doing well.
[SPEAKER_02]: He might get the attention from the right people.
[SPEAKER_02]: He might get the engagement from the right people, which makes a lot of other people notice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or he might just be someone who's just been favored by the algorithm.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the algorithm really favors only the consistent and the people who are doing the right things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would perhaps pay more attention
[SPEAKER_02]: At least for the people who are coming on the speaker panel, Bob, that I would say that you might have 5,000, 10,000 followers, but I want to also check your impressions.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to check the kind of people engaging with your content, because now this is a relatively small space.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I've been in spaces and I've hosted spaces with 100 plus people in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you get a lot of let me put it in a let me put it in a
[SPEAKER_02]: As bluntly as possible, you get a lot of trolls, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So how do you filter them?
[SPEAKER_02]: You check their profile, you check their bio, you check their content and the impressions or engagement they get on the content.
[SPEAKER_02]: You filter them like that and then you get them on top.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how I would do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great points, Bob, appreciate this, whatever you're bringing to the table.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Johnson, I hope this helps whatever we spoke about in terms of you having troubles of staying 100% distraction-free.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see Will has joined the space.
[SPEAKER_02]: He is somebody who I'm sure will have a lot to talk about on this topic of getting into deep work.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I hope Johnson, whatever we mentioned was helpful to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, let's get back to the topic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get back to deep work.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were talking about how you can apply the deep work to your life, even if you're working a nine to five.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to go or build a tower like in the woods, go to the woods by Carl Jung.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't need any fancy tools.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just need the ability to concentrate without distraction.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the ability to concentrate without distraction is not gained overnight.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is developed over a period of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't sit down to meditate and then expect to meditate completely for 60 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to develop your ability.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how do you do this?
[SPEAKER_02]: You set yourself a time for 60 to 90 minutes, preferably in the morning, before you're 95, if you're working at 95, at 5 a.m. ish.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why people who wake up at 5 a.m., you see, for a period of time, you see transformation in them after one, two, three years.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's because they have these periods of time that they work for one hour, two hours, three hours, every single day.
[SPEAKER_02]: for a period of one, two, three years, definitely transformations happen because they work in the deep work state.
[SPEAKER_02]: So block 60 to 90 minutes on your calendar, not free time, but actual blocked time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You treat it like a meeting that you cannot miss.
[SPEAKER_02]: Treat it like a meeting that you need to pay full attention to.
[SPEAKER_02]: You pick one task to do in that deep working block.
[SPEAKER_02]: One task, not three, one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perhaps it's writing one module of your product.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perhaps it's reading one chapter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perhaps it's extracting one framework.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perhaps it's researching one creator, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I might, because I find I might, I might just go into Kevin's profile
[SPEAKER_02]: um because he has some success on x noticeable success i might just go into his profile and research completely for one night right it might be anything pick one task um remove all distractions put your phone on airplane mode not just silent airplane mode close every tab accept what you need so if you are if you want to write for 60 minutes close every other tab apart from
[SPEAKER_02]: just your writing document tell people if needed that you're available even your family no succumbing to just one quick check on your for your notifications guys we discussed about this it takes you 13 to 20 minutes to get back into focus mode if you get distracted for even a brief moment of time so no succumbing to one quick check
[SPEAKER_02]: and the thing is guys it will be hard the first 20 minutes will suck your brain will fight you because we have been wired throughout our lives to pick up our phones from our pocket every five minutes so you will want to check your phone you will think of the 10 urgent things you need to be doing but you have to push through and around minute 25 to 30 you will feel the flow
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have been able to push through it, you will feel it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And writers will relate to me, people who are writing, who are on a run can relate that something does shift at minute 20, at minute 30.
[SPEAKER_02]: You drop into the deep work state.
[SPEAKER_02]: Time actually disappears in a way.
[SPEAKER_02]: The work just starts flowing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you do this for a period of 30 days,
[SPEAKER_02]: Guys day one to day seven you're actually training your brain it's going to be hard you might only get 30 to 40 minutes of real depth out of 60 to 90 minutes but day 8 to day 14 within the second week it gets easier you can hit the 60 minutes consistently and day 15 to day 21 in about the three week time you are actually addicted to deep work deep work actually feels good shallow work
[SPEAKER_02]: actually feels hollow to you right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Checking your notifications while writing or reading actually feels hollow to you right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're a different person.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've created more in one month than the previous six months combined.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to say a quick hello to Will Carter over here, who I'm sure has a lot to say on the subject.
[SPEAKER_02]: Will, welcome to the space.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to
[SPEAKER_02]: put you on the spot here and ask you a couple of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Firstly, what do you think of the subject of the deep work?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think do you think it takes a while to get into the habit of deep work for someone who's never really done the deep kind of work without checking their phone?
[SPEAKER_02]: How long does it take?
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, do you have a particular kind of, let's say,
[SPEAKER_02]: way you enter the deep state or deep flow state?
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, first things first.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good morning, everybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, let me let's answer that as two separate questions, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'll keep this on topic today.
[SPEAKER_06]: So first of all, what is deep work?
[SPEAKER_06]: That is focus without resistance, effectively.
[SPEAKER_06]: So to somebody who is
[SPEAKER_06]: distraction-addicted, we shall say, they will find it inherently challenging.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the brain, if you think about what it actually is, is a it's so complicated, but it's so beautiful.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the main thing it's looking for, right, is to maintain the status quo, predictability, stability, survivability.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if somebody is distraction addicted and they're in a heightened sense of effectively what is survival mode, right, always unable to relax,
[SPEAKER_06]: they will find it naturally quite difficult to get into the deep flow, which requires an alpha brainwave.
[SPEAKER_06]: It requires a relaxed mind.
[SPEAKER_06]: Where if somebody is hyper-stimulated all the time, this is what attention deficit disorder is, which is chronic inability to relax the mind, they will find it difficult.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the mind will scream very loudly because it wants its predictable
[SPEAKER_06]: even if it's unsafe, or sorry, even if it's uncomfortable, it wants its predictable known routine.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what I do is focus blocks, 90 minutes, and I do two sprints, essentially.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'll sit down with my community for 90 minutes, we'll put our cameras on, and we'll be like, okay, for the next 90 minutes, nothing else gets done except the important thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what we'll do is I'll typically lead us through a short guided meditation for like two, three minutes to relax the mind, because it is, it's best to work with the mind, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because if it's constantly in a state of looking for danger, for stimulation, for trying to get away from being still, nothing can happen, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing of note can happen.
[SPEAKER_06]: Even if you close all the other tabs, as you mentioned, which are all very helpful things to do,
[SPEAKER_06]: the person will simply be, they'll write a word, then they'll try and edit the word, then they'll write the word, then they'll try and edit the word, and nothing gets done.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can put somebody in an empty room, right, and give them one task to do, but if they don't feel safe in the doing of it, nothing will get done.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the idea is,
[SPEAKER_06]: that we bring ourselves to a place where we can actually hit that flow state, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have a sufficiently interesting and challenging task.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a state that we can occupy that's going to allow us to access the flow.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because again, if we're in an overstimulated beta state of mind, we're just not going to be able to get there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we focus on the task to the point where the brain then becomes fatigued, which, you know, the research says is about 30 to 40 minutes.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think you guys know Dave.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dave Myers comes in these spaces sometimes.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think he told me it was like 45 minutes before it needs a break.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I do quick two, three minute meditation, 45 minutes sprint, five, 10 minute rest, 45 minutes sprint.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's my work block for the day.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's how I do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I wrote a book in a month, so it works.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guys, did you hear that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Will Carter just explained his, let's say, framework to getting into the flow state.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm going to just break it down for you all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just give me a moment while I fill my water bottle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for that patience, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no co-hosts these days, so it's hard to fill the silences.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the thing, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what Will said was he enters the state of meditation.
[SPEAKER_02]: He he talked about and then he puts and then he goes on this 45 minute deep sprint of deep work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, of course, takes 10 to 15 minutes of break, reset and then 45 minutes once again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let me break it down here.
[SPEAKER_02]: He talked about when you're in this deep, let's say when you're in this active, distracted beta state.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope I'm using beta right over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you're in the state, it's hard for you to actually get into that flow state, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is why I myself would recommend to start your deep work sessions
[SPEAKER_02]: sometime after you wake up, maybe 30 minutes after you wake up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you wake up at 5 a.m., maybe at 530, you can sit in front of your laptop and start writing for 90 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's easier for you, number one, because you have no no notifications from anybody, no WhatsApp messages.
[SPEAKER_02]: Number two, you're already in a relaxed state in the morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are already close to, let's say, alpha brainwaves, as we would call it.
[SPEAKER_02]: because you're not stimulated by the thoughts that has occurred to you through the stress of the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me put it that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for me, for example, it's hard for me to go back into a deep work state after this space because I've been talking continuously for like 90 minutes, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: My brain is stimulated.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's thinking about what I spoke in the space.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm kind of tired.
[SPEAKER_02]: My throat feels a little sore.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's hard for me, which is why I have the spaces happen, which is why I host these spaces in the evenings for me after I've done the heavy lifting of the day, which is why you also notice a lot of 5 a.m. people who wake up at 5 a.m. for periods of time, for an elongated period of time to achieve this level of success because
[SPEAKER_02]: Number one, they are in this alpha state naturally.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't have to meditate to reach the alpha state.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're almost naturally there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Number two, no distractions, either from your family or from your notifications.
[SPEAKER_02]: And getting one block, one block, deep work block done during the day also is progress.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to get two, three blocks of work, deep work block per day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I try, because I try for three deep work blocks and you can't really have more than three deep work sessions in a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can say this with confidence because I listened to a podcast from Andrew Huberman.
[SPEAKER_02]: He talks about how you're pretty much, you've used up your brain energy, creative energy after three 90 minutes blocks.
[SPEAKER_02]: So having about three 90 minute blocks for me is my limit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then afterwards, after which I host the space.
[SPEAKER_02]: The space is just like me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's it's I'm not using much of my cognitive load.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not really writing, reading or anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just talking about what I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it feels easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, thanks, Will, for for your
[SPEAKER_02]: process of getting into deep work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, thanks for your framework.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was really helpful.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, let's move back to the topic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were talking about how it's difficult for you to enter the
[SPEAKER_02]: deep work state or do the deep work state right away in the beginning during the week, during the first day.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first week is going to be hard for you to sit without distractions, without notifications for 60 to 90 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: The second week, it gets easier.
[SPEAKER_02]: The third week, you actually feel good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Deep work actually feels good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And by week four, by like a month, you are completely a different person and you
[SPEAKER_02]: When you look back, you will see that you have created more in one month than the previous six months combined.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can tell this to you myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is my second gig on X during my first gig, which is before my marriage.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to be working, I used to consider myself to be productive, but I used to be working in a, let's say, shallow, I used to get not deep work done, but shallow work done.
[SPEAKER_02]: which we spoke about the definition of shallow work versus deep work in the beginning of the space.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can check out the definition of shallow work and deep work in the thread which is above guys in the Jumbotron.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I used to do is probably I have a textbook or a book opened or my journal open or my writing tool open and then I'm also
[SPEAKER_02]: Notifications, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Replying to notifications on X because I wanted to be that guy who gets a lot of engagements on my posts.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to be that guy who gets a lot of impressions on my posts.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I realized that if you engage a lot, those people will engage back at you, back to you, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So give and take.
[SPEAKER_02]: People on X do kind of reciprocate.
[SPEAKER_02]: I figured that out and I'm like, okay, let me engage with 200 people and
[SPEAKER_02]: what i used to i used to just post maybe one or two liners and i used to get 200 engagements not kidding not gonna lie uh you can check my highlights um and go through my highlights one or two one or two lines post that's pretty much it nothing viral about it nothing fancy about it 150 200 engagements likes and i don't know how many impressions couple thousand impressions i've not even um reached a thousand followers yet but couple thousand impressions not gonna lie guys
[SPEAKER_02]: But I couldn't get any deep work done.
[SPEAKER_02]: I couldn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was nowhere close to launching my business in about 70 days of deep work.
[SPEAKER_02]: 70 days since I'm back on X.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is my second gig.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never been closer to launching my business.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never been more proud about the work that I've done so far.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's because I've set aside time to actually get things done.
[SPEAKER_02]: And no shallow work, no texting, no checking phones.
[SPEAKER_02]: My phone's on DND throughout the day, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see Timo's comment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, most creators spread too thin and end up being posting mediocre stuff across multiple platforms instead of dominating one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to spread yourself too thin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guys, you want to focus on one platform, honestly speaking, which is why my energy is on X. I don't look at the other platforms which I'm active on, but that's through my VA. That's pretty much it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing else.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very true.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to spread yourself too thin.
[SPEAKER_02]: One more point I want to mention to Johnson, who raised a question, who is a developer and he seems to believe that
[SPEAKER_02]: at least his question was, I can't really be 100% distraction-free.
[SPEAKER_02]: We gave the example of Pavel Durov, the CEO of Telegram, who was one of, in my eyes, the greatest developer, one of the greatest developers born in our time, in our generation.
[SPEAKER_02]: He managed to escape distraction and create, number one, Telegram, and number two,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a guy smarter than Pavel Durov guys and we may not even know about him it's his elder brother so his elder brother basically is off social media even till date and he is almost never to be if you think Pavel Durov is like low-key and not on social media and not on phones this guy is even more low-key and he
[SPEAKER_02]: according to Pavel Dudov, is smarter than him.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, it is possible to be distraction-free if you set your mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I'm going to, the reason I brought this up is because I want to tell the personal journey of Cal Newport.
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, for the people who are just recently joining the space, like Will,
[SPEAKER_02]: And Timo is that I'm reading Deep Work by Cal Newport at this point in time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to share his story before I wrap things up, his own journey, because it's proof that this works.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Cal went to MIT for his PhD, Theoretical Computer Science.
[SPEAKER_02]: He shared an office down the hall from a MacArthur Genius Grant winner, by the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: He shared an office with a MacArthur Genius Grant winner.
[SPEAKER_02]: He watched this professor, who became a professor at MIT before even reaching the legal age of drinking, by the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So before 21, he became a professor at MIT.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he watched this guy sit and stare at a whiteboard for hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes other scholars
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, who's surrounding him and just sitting but just staring at the whiteboard for hours, thinking deeply.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cal talks about how he would go for lunch and then he would come back and he's, he finds them still staring at the whiteboard.
[SPEAKER_02]: That particular guy, that particular professor published 16 papers in one year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Cal Newport learned and he gave us the learnings that
[SPEAKER_02]: Deep work is the norm at the highest levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is normal.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you go enter the, let's say, playground of people in the highest echelons of life, you will see they dedicate their day to get some deep work done.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is normal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Deep work is normal for people at the highest levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not an exception.
[SPEAKER_02]: And looking at this, Cal Newport kind of adopted this lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's never had Facebook or Twitter back in the day when he called it Twitter.
[SPEAKER_02]: This book was published in 2016.
[SPEAKER_02]: He never had Facebook or Twitter back in the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: He doesn't surf the web and he got his first smartphone only in 2012 because
[SPEAKER_02]: his pregnant wife back in the day gave him an ultimatum that you need to have a phone before your son is born.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why he got his first smartphone in 2012.
[SPEAKER_02]: So deep work is the norm, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not something new.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you go if you meet people who are in the highest echelons of life, it is the norm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cal Newport then says that he is generally hard to reach.
[SPEAKER_02]: No personal email on his website.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in the 10 years after college, Cal Newport published four books.
[SPEAKER_02]: He earned a PhD.
[SPEAKER_02]: He wrote peer-reviewed papers at a high rate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he got hired as a tenure-track professor at Georgetown.
[SPEAKER_02]: all while rarely working past 5 or 6 p.m and by the way he has two kids he has two kids so while he never worked barely worked after 5 or 6 p.m uh the only time he worked after 5 or 6 p.m is to write his blogs and which his favorite time to do was apparently after his kids went to sleep
[SPEAKER_02]: So he would write his blogs, he would set aside 90 minutes after his kids went to sleep to write his blogs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm just going to quickly read a quote from Newport himself, where he says, I build my days around a core of carefully chosen deep work.
[SPEAKER_02]: With the shallow activities, I absolutely cannot avoid batched into smaller bursts at the peripheries of my schedule.
[SPEAKER_02]: So any kind of shallow work you have to do, for example, engage on X, for example, maybe worry about what you have to, anything to worry about if you have.
[SPEAKER_02]: or scheduling other things he actually batched it into smaller bursts at the peripheries of his schedule meaning at the end of his days at the end of his days when he doesn't have to use the creativity of his brain and yeah this is the part that actually hit me is he says I'm comfortable being bored
[SPEAKER_02]: and this can be a surprisingly rewarded skill especially on a lazy DC summer night listening to a nationals game slowly unfold on the radio he's comfortable being bored and that is a rare situation now people are bored when they get bored like they don't even allow the state of being bored happen if they are about to get bored they pull out their phones from their pockets and let's say scroll
[SPEAKER_02]: Number one, on Instagram, on YouTube, on Twitter, X maybe, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So you must develop the kind of habit of being bored.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why I feel back in the day, you find a lot of people achieve greatness in their early 20s and 30s back in the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: uh Marcus Aurelius like the great rulers like you can you can talk about the great rulers Genghis Khan he might have been an evil person to a lot of people but to his own countrymen he was a great person it's because he they had the ability
[SPEAKER_02]: to sit in a room being bored and once they enter the bored state they start to imagine things and the power of imagination is lost guys in this day and age.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to move to Will because I know he has a lot of things to talk about this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah I wanted to just speak on this because this is something that I've struggled with you know over the last 18 months that I've been on X and even just in entrepreneurship in general.
[SPEAKER_06]: You talked about
[SPEAKER_06]: how people got a lot done at a young age, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: And people these days, their immediate default is, I don't have the time, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: And I wanna just...
[SPEAKER_06]: call BS on that, because the time didn't go anywhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: I said to somebody the other day, right, time does us the benefit of never changing the supply.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we've managed, and this is intentional, by the way, this is the way that our society is designed to keep people distracted, to keep people scattered.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is unfortunately very much baked into the society, but the time is actually
[SPEAKER_06]: Not the issue.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's never the issue.
[SPEAKER_06]: You always have enough time.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have exactly the right amount, same amount as everyone else.
[SPEAKER_06]: The idea here is that it's very rarely about finding the time to add in stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: People will tell me I don't have five to 10 minutes to do a daily practice and yet 60 minutes or more, they will scroll because their brain is wired for the dopamine that comes with the scroll and they don't need it.
[SPEAKER_06]: but they're not aware that they're wasting that time every day.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like for people on X, I know there's like Kevin and Timo creators on X.
[SPEAKER_06]: You want people to keep scrolling.
[SPEAKER_06]: You do.
[SPEAKER_06]: As a creator, we need to consumers, but if you want to be a creator, and this is why a lot of people who say create more than you consume.
[SPEAKER_06]: The time that is spent is often not productive, but it feels productive, even when you're being busy doing tasks.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the greatest people that I know are the people who are able to ruthlessly cut away anything that is inefficient.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it seems like they're getting a lot done, but really they're doing a few things very, very well with focus and leverage.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the things that I'm almost certain now, I've worked with enough people to say for certain that it's a pattern that I'm seeing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't speak for everybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: You could do twice as much as you're doing right now and work half the time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Almost guaranteed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like literally almost guaranteed.
[SPEAKER_06]: There might be somebody who's an exception to the rule.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure there is, but most people are capable of about four times.
[SPEAKER_06]: If they work the same amount, there were about four times the output.
[SPEAKER_06]: However.
[SPEAKER_06]: is a downside to this as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: What the brain requires, as we talked about earlier on, is that break, is that intentional rest.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is where most people go wrong.
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll think that I'm taking a break and then I'll scroll my phone and I'll hyper-stimulate my brain.
[SPEAKER_06]: Short-form content is particularly damaging for this because you're opening
[SPEAKER_06]: an emotional loop every two to three seconds, which the brain doesn't have time to fully process.
[SPEAKER_06]: And all those open loops are basically like open programs on your computer.
[SPEAKER_06]: It will get to a point where you just feel exhausted and you've done nothing.
[SPEAKER_06]: If this is sounding familiar, it's because this is the norm.
[SPEAKER_06]: So most people are living completely exhausted with nothing productive achieved.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they think they're doing the right things, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm taking it easy.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm taking a break.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm making sure my mental health is in order.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yet they're bombarding themselves 24 seven with endless open loops that will literally keep them burned out.
[SPEAKER_06]: And nothing was produced.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's, it's something that I'm, I'm studying more and more.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm looking into the science behind it, but it proves itself in performance.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you just stop.
[SPEAKER_06]: overstimulating the brain and allow it to rest, to be still, it is capable of so much more than it's currently showing you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I absolutely love everything that you said over there, especially the last point, if you stop overstimulating the brain.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll get to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a lot of things to talk about that end, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I got a lot of ideas from you regarding this, Will, by the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yes,
[SPEAKER_02]: We are wired these days to have our brain overstimulated, like you said.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because we have overstimulated our brain throughout our lives, it gets harder and harder to focus.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gets harder and harder to focus.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have to, let's say, rewire our overstimulation, which is what I'm in the process of, by the way, which is why the moment I wake up,
[SPEAKER_02]: I immediately go into movement.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go for a run, because when I go for a run, I'm focusing on breathing the right way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm on my breath.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I'm on my breath, I don't have a lot of thoughts running in my head.
[SPEAKER_02]: Number one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Number two is the movement can also be in the form of lifting weights.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you're lifting 100 kilos, 100 pounds, you can't be thinking a lot of thoughts.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're only focused inside your body, inside your muscles.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm kind of slowing down my brain through these 30 years of stimulation that I've had.
[SPEAKER_02]: By number one, when I wake up, two hours, no phone, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: movement.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I'm moving my body, I get to focus on my breath, less number of thoughts.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm changing the balance of my brain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's say if it was moving 100 miles per hour three months ago, I'm kind of changing the balance and I can feel it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can feel it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm less reactive to certain things.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, since the time I got married, there have been a lot of times that I got into
[SPEAKER_02]: let's say a couple of arguments emotional arguments with my wife but I can feel the difference when I've in the past three months when I wake up and just move my body and I've kind of changed the
[SPEAKER_02]: let's say the balance I don't know the exact terms I'm sure you would will but I've kind of changed the balance uh of if it was running at 100 miles per hour it's no more running at 100 miles per hour it's probably at 50 I still have a lot of work to do but uh yeah I can feel the difference already um
[SPEAKER_02]: The hack to rewiring yourself, in my eyes, you don't have to, of course, meditation.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to go all the way there, but just move your body, guys, as much as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Strong body, strong mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I would always, that's the kind of mantra that I'm kind of following at this point in time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another point that you raised here, Will, which I kind of want to talk about, is people get the sense of
[SPEAKER_02]: they're getting a lot of work done right this feeling that they're getting work done so and this I want to pull from atomic habits here where James Clear talks about people feel productive when they're in a state of motion right when they're in a state of motion meaning either it is reading more
[SPEAKER_02]: purchasing another course and going through another course, watching a YouTube video and doing more research in quotes, I would say.
[SPEAKER_02]: They feel productive because this is the state of motion.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is not being productive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually being productive is getting the work done.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is what is productive.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they feel like they're getting work done by just being in motion.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's not it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Getting the work done, doing the thing is actually what is productive.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thanks for bringing that point up, Will.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to also pull another thing from this book that I read, Building a Second Brain by Thiago Forte.
[SPEAKER_02]: I completed this last week.
[SPEAKER_02]: He says that the myth of the writer
[SPEAKER_02]: Sitting down before a completely blank page or the artist at a completely blank canvas is just that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a myth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Professional creatives constantly draw on outside sources of inspiration.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to stress on this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Professional creators constantly draw on outside sources of inspiration.
[SPEAKER_02]: This can be in the form of their own experiences, observations, probably lessons learned from successes and failures alike.
[SPEAKER_02]: and the ideas of others.
[SPEAKER_02]: If there is a secret to creativity, it is that it emerges from everyday efforts to gather and organize our influences.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guys, I'm going to read the last line once again.
[SPEAKER_02]: If there is a secret to creativity, it is that it emerges from everyday efforts to gather and organize our influences.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he says creativity.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, the secret to creativity is the organization of our influences.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these days we are influenced by what?
[SPEAKER_02]: By YouTube, by the videos that you are distracted with, by scrolling, by other people's maybe successes and feeling jealous, envy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: but in fact for example my wife by netflix my wife is was watching netflix uh the other day i remember this clearly um and i kind of watched one episode with her the next day i'm thinking about that um episode i'm thinking about how i felt while watching that episode and then i'm thinking to myself dude this is not what this is not what you want you want to be thinking about what
[SPEAKER_02]: what you read the book chapters that you're reading you want to be constantly thinking about that because and you want to be constantly thinking about how to progress in your business you don't want to be thinking about this right so you kind of have to destroy your distractions guys if you want to be more creative you kind of want to have to destroy your influences that you gather from your day-to-day life
[SPEAKER_02]: And only then will you move forward in whatever endeavor that you choose, at least at a faster rate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Only then will you be able to give 100% in the endeavors that you choose, in my eyes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thanks for bringing that up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this rose a lot of thoughts for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, got a lot, I hope.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was very interesting points that you brought up, which brought me to a tangent like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were talking about how Cal Newport was saying that he's comfortable being bored.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we then went on to a tangent about how, you know, people have lost the ability to be bored.
[SPEAKER_02]: And every time this bored sensation comes to them, they pull out their phones and they want to get distracted, which is why they cannot imagine
[SPEAKER_02]: the kind of business they want to build, they cannot imagine the kind of future they want to have, they cannot imagine the kind of progress they want to have in their lives.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to build, I want to talk a little bit more on this, where the ability to be bored and then once you're bored, you have the ability to imagine.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have lost that, number one, and number two,
[SPEAKER_02]: is back in the day when people used to feel bored let's say when people used to feel bored and there was no technology they used to sit let's say let's go into the kingdom of a ruler right the king would sit down being bored with his ministers of five people and once they're bored or something like that they would imagine number one how to conquer another kingdom they would imagine how to better their kingdom
[SPEAKER_02]: they would imagine how to better their lives.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what we have lost.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have lost that number one sense of imagination.
[SPEAKER_02]: And number two, we have lost this concept of mastermind as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, Napoleon Hill talks about this concept of building a mastermind, uh, where he says mastermind is something where two or more minds combine,
[SPEAKER_02]: together to achieve a similar or a same goal.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when two or more minds combine to achieve a goal, you achieve that goal faster.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we not only have lost the ability to imagine, we have also lost the network or the people that we can imagine it with to fasten our process.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, the Wright brothers, both of them combined built the airplane first.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to move to Will quickly on this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you kind of touched on the thing that is the most important in the world to me, which is the imagination.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'll briefly touch on the mastermind principle from Napoleon Hill, because he said something that was so beautiful in that book, that two or more minds focused upon an outcome constitute an unstoppable force.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the reason I do a mastermind, the reason I'm in several other masterminds isn't because those other people know more than me.
[SPEAKER_06]: It isn't because I know more than anybody else.
[SPEAKER_06]: We all have access to the same information these days.
[SPEAKER_06]: The goal is that when we have two or more minds on the process, we have two different perspectives and we can now see outside the boundaries of that which we believe to be true.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's so valuable.
[SPEAKER_06]: But to briefly touch on the concept of imagination and why it's so vital and why I'm going to go on record as saying that if you cannot be still and know that I am God, you just cannot succeed beyond the boundaries of your physical self.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know that sounds a little esoteric, but let me break it down.
[SPEAKER_06]: The brain, and I talked about this in the video today, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: The brain does not know.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're in an alpha slash theta brainwave state, the brain does not know the difference between physical stimuli, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Sensory data, sight, sound, hearing, and imagined data.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all the same to the subconscious mind when you're in a state of theta, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Hypnotherapy, essentially, which is what I do.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the idea here of be still and know that I am God, in the Bible it says the only way to enter the kingdom of heaven, right, is to be still.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is to be like little children who have no concept of the imagination being unreal.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right?
[SPEAKER_06]: And it also says that, Seek ye first the kingdom of heaven, all these things will be added unto you.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's almost bookended, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: To get into the kingdom of heaven, you must be calm.
[SPEAKER_06]: You must be clear.
[SPEAKER_06]: You must be still.
[SPEAKER_06]: You must be childlike.
[SPEAKER_06]: You must be not racing around a thousand different thoughts.
[SPEAKER_06]: then that's the actual only way to change.
[SPEAKER_06]: So to take the biblical, which I absolutely adore, and bring it to the practical, to bring that into modern science and biology, when you are still and you enter a theta brainwave state or even a low alpha, right, which is like when you're watching TV or when you're reading a good book,
[SPEAKER_06]: and you get that sleepy feeling, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a low alpha.
[SPEAKER_06]: In that frame of mind, the brain is not hyper alert anymore.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not looking for danger.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's signaling that this is a safe place.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when you use imagination in that way, it actually trains what the brain uses as its filter of reality.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, I talk about this a lot because it's so vital.
[SPEAKER_06]: The average person is so stressed out of their mind that they never leave a survival state.
[SPEAKER_06]: And because they never leave a survival state, their brain is constantly on alert.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's constantly looking for threats.
[SPEAKER_06]: It can never update.
[SPEAKER_06]: It can never be safe to change because it's always on the alert for danger.
[SPEAKER_06]: The way that we change the self-concept, right, which is, this is, if I was gonna specialize in one thing for the rest of my life, it's this, it's subconscious identity.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because who you believe you are controls exactly what you think and what you do and the lens that you see reality through.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is not true that money is hard to make.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is a perception.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is a belief.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can't change that belief if you're constantly struggling to pay bills.
[SPEAKER_06]: You must get still and imagine a life of overflow, which is what, exactly what you were talking about there, Phoebe.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is what it means to know, essentially to be still and know that I am God, is to access the kingdom.
[SPEAKER_06]: Christ in man is the man's imagination.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the right hand of the father, the imagination, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So the goal here, and he also says, I'm gonna keep quoting the Bible.
[SPEAKER_06]: I do apologize for anyone who is not biblically related, but this is pure gold in the Bible.
[SPEAKER_06]: When he said that the only way to my father is through me, when Christ said the only way to the father is through me,
[SPEAKER_06]: Think about what the imagination is.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the only way to access the kingdom of heaven, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't do it when you are, when you think it's all about you, the physical egoic vessel.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I can of mine own self do nothing.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is the father within that does the work.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is all saying the same thing, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: To prayer, to do a true prayer is not a supplication to something outside of yourself.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is a mental appropriation of the state.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it says, you know, it's your father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom.
[SPEAKER_06]: But unless you have discipline and focus, you will never hold your attention on it long enough for the self-concept to be updated, to be true to you, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Put your mind not on things that are below, but put your mind on things that are above, because you are in the world, but not of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is all giving us the instruction to live this way.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, I think, Vivi, that it's very deliberate.
[SPEAKER_06]: that the ability to focus, the ability to pay attention is the number one thing that's under threat.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's incredibly deliberate because that's how you control a population.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't try and physically control them.
[SPEAKER_06]: You change who they believe they are.
[SPEAKER_06]: You put them in a chronic stress mode and they'll control themselves, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because now they're too afraid to do anything and they don't believe they can because they're limited to the evidence of their senses.
[SPEAKER_06]: Whereas all great people knew that it was as within, so without.
[SPEAKER_06]: They must change internally first.
[SPEAKER_06]: Plato said it best, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Man can change his reality by changing his mind.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yet if you're so externally focused, you lose the ability to do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I could go much deeper, but I don't want to hijack your space, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, if you have any questions, I can answer them.
[SPEAKER_06]: But this, if you do nothing else in the next 30 days to 60 days to change a life,
[SPEAKER_06]: learn to be still, go within and pray, really pray.
[SPEAKER_06]: And not like, Oh, please make, give me this.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're not begging God for something.
[SPEAKER_06]: God doesn't react to that.
[SPEAKER_06]: You become one with the thing you want.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the prayer is effective.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now it is when you pray, believe you have received and you shall.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I love the metaphysical.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love the biblical, but like, this is purely backed up with science for the, those like me who didn't used to be spiritual, who needed the hard science.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is 100% congruent behavioral psychology, neuroscience.
[SPEAKER_06]: It all says the same thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: You must be it before it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can only be it when you are disidentified with the human and re-identified with God.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the only way it works.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can only be it if you believe it and you will start believing it if you have taken micro actions to prove to yourself that you are that person.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry to have kind of butchered whatever you said in the end, Will, but for you to believe that you are that person, you need to have taken that action or micro actions
[SPEAKER_02]: for a period of time for yourself to believe that you are that person.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, if you want to, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me just jump in there, because this is where a lot of people get confused.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I got super confused, right, when I first got into this.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's like, people say, just take action.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, well, if I knew what action to take, I wouldn't be stuck.
[SPEAKER_06]: So here's what really helped me.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I want to add to what you said, because you are absolutely correct.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you think you can do this and take no action, you will remain
[SPEAKER_06]: in a state of delusion, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: And I employ tactical delusion, guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: I really think you've got to be above your senses at times.
[SPEAKER_06]: But here's the distinction, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: You have awareness, a nervous system, and an egoic mind.
[SPEAKER_06]: Your awareness, that we can say is one with Christ.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the Son.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the Son of God.
[SPEAKER_06]: right, which is the part of you that can imagine, that can see things.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now you can use that part of you to imagine and visualize and create as fact new imaginal experiences.
[SPEAKER_06]: The subconscious doesn't care where you get your data from, it only cares what you're experiencing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And again science has proven this beyond a shadow of a doubt that you can, and you can use that famous experiment right now, imagine holding a lemon in your hand
[SPEAKER_06]: cutting it open and placing it in your mouth and your mouth will literally change.
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll feel that sort of sourness.
[SPEAKER_06]: Your brain doesn't care where you get your data.
[SPEAKER_06]: The physical world is in effect.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the action, Vivi, the reason the action is important, it isn't to change the state, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: This is why, this is where so many people go wrong with manifestation.
[SPEAKER_06]: And God, I love the concept, but I hate the industry because they'll try and tell you that you can stay the same, do a magic dance and get a different outcome.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that will never work.
[SPEAKER_06]: You must change, then the outcome changes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Input versus output.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's simple maths.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the idea here, right, is your awareness needs nothing.
[SPEAKER_06]: It needs no action, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Your awareness needs no action.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can be successful right now if you believe it.
[SPEAKER_06]: To him that believes, all things are possible.
[SPEAKER_06]: However, you also have an ego, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: And your ego is your human mind that interacts only with the sense world, only the external world, the world of Maya, the Satan, this is what it means, the deceiver.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it will try and tell you that the world is one way.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now you need to take action in the physical world or your egoic mind will always be fighting you.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the action isn't cause, the action is effect.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what I say to people is, if you're not taking action, if you're procrastinating, if you're self-sabotaging, that is an indication that somewhere up river, you have a kink in the hose.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it goes spiritual, awareness, I am, self-concept, mental, thoughts, emotions, your mental dialogue, the way you perceive things, actions.
[SPEAKER_06]: If your spiritual and mental are aligned, your physical will be aligned.
[SPEAKER_06]: You will take action.
[SPEAKER_06]: The only reason you don't take action is because you fear it or there's resistance to it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because if you know how to do something and it has a result you want, you just do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Think about switching a light on or going to the fridge for something.
[SPEAKER_06]: No resistance, no block to the action.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you don't look to the action to define the awareness.
[SPEAKER_06]: The awareness defines the action.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if the action is not being taken, you have an internal problem, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is where most people go wrong is they think I can grind and grind and grind through my actions to update my awareness.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, you can, but that's playing the game on hard mode.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's bringing earth to heaven.
[SPEAKER_06]: It says, don't do that as in heaven.
[SPEAKER_06]: So on earth, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I just misclicked over there, Will.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's probably for the best, mate.
[SPEAKER_06]: I could talk literally all day this, but I can see... Hey, Will, it's okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can keep talking because everything that you're talking about, it resonates with me because that's what I'm doing right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can't wait to speak upon that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, great topic.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, my friend.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, again, I'll pass it to VB.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not a co-host here, but I think we should go to Nino next.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I mean, Will.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love to have you as a co-host.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't know if you have the time for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, next time onwards, I will pass you the co-host and you accept it or reject it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's on you, whether you have the time or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: But thanks for your points, Will.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a lot to say, but I want to hear from Nino first.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been a while and wonderful to have you, Nino, over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you have to say about this?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I mean, Will pretty much
[SPEAKER_03]: is saying what I've been doing for the last couple of years, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then right now, getting closer to God, and here's the thing is, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I grew up as a Roman Catholic, now as a Christian.
[SPEAKER_03]: When God talks to you, he doesn't scream, he whispers.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how can you hear him, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You kind of have to like declutter your mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause he's always been there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And listen, I'm not saying that every, you know, everybody has to believe on God.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody has their own beliefs, but I know for myself, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's three areas of my life where I wanted to, you know, lower my stress, find my balance when it comes to, especially today's life, because it's so go, go, go.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then obviously.
[SPEAKER_03]: with these smartphones, our brains are actively just firing off.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it is important, the content that you're looking at, what you're listening.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't be where I am today if it wasn't for spaces like this, because getting other people perspectives.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the three areas, when it comes to the personal growth for me, it's God, family, and community, because that's what I grew up on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Going back to the basics, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Before there was all this distraction and people are stressed out, they're overworked, they don't love their jobs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then what makes you think that they're going to love themselves because of their situation?
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's not really like you have to change your whole life.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's these little, you know, these 1% change, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's like, you've been a certain way for so long.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not going to be able to like automatically do a 360 degree turn.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, so it's just those, you know, habits and the routines and, and, you know, when the clients come to me, I would say 90 to 95% is these two areas, Nino, I'm stressed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it doesn't matter what field you're in.
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then finding their balance with life, work, family.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for me is, uh, what really works for me is meditation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when people sign up with my program, that's one of the things that I want people to do and think about this, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not going to take too much time is five, 10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you're doing things, it goes by so fast, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Even brushing your teeth or trying to get your coffee ready before you leave for the house and, and, you know, get to the daily grind.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when you literally are sitting down in a, you know, let's say, uh, no lights and you just have no phone and you're meditating, it is the longest 10 or 15 minutes ever.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what happens is it slows, like you kind of readjust, uh, your nervous system.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you're able to really, and here's the thing is when it comes to like stress and not having that balance, there's pain and inflammation.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's in your bloodstream.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's in your organs.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are things that I noticed about myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is why I wanted to be a life coach because.
[SPEAKER_03]: everything that I've learned.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, that's what I'm going to, that's what I've been practicing and people are coming to me because they've gotten to know when it comes to monetization and this, you know, how do you fix that?
[SPEAKER_03]: You just have to like show people who you are.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, to me, it's not really like what business you're in.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like who you are as a person.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then what is your story?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how you can connect with the audience.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, for me is, you know, meditation, um, you know, God,
[SPEAKER_03]: family, community, and you can find it all here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, and that's why listening to will, it's, it's an extension of what I'm already doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, whenever you guys are going to do a space like this, uh, I want to be in, I don't have to be a co-host because I'm always moving around.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm always doing things, but I mean, I could be a co-host if you wanted to, but yeah, that's definitely in my wheelhouse when it comes to, because your brain, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Doesn't know reality.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you, so when I wake up in the morning, I wake up with gratitude, but then also knowing that, Hey, I'm going to be the best person that I can be, because that's how we can be right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'd be the best versions of ourselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, you know, we are good enough and think about all the good things that we do have in our lives.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of times, like with my clients, it's like, you know, regret mistakes that they've done and they're not really living in the present.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that's why people are dealing with anxieties.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're anxious because they're not living in the moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you live in the moment and realize, you know, all the things that are beautiful in your life, you're just going to feel better.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what I started doing with myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then every aspect of my life.
[SPEAKER_03]: It got better.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't happen overnight, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to practice it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm telling you people, if you take the time and you value your time and what your priority is in life, I think for most of us that are in this space right here, we just want inner peace, but also we want to be successful in whatever, uh, you know, areas of our lives we want to improve on.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you for the floor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank you for your points, you know, just quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Firstly, I love everything that you said, by the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: I totally resonate with it, with the meditations and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I would like to ask you, in terms of getting in line with the topic of the space, is there a process
[SPEAKER_02]: you did talk about meditation yes but is there like a formula that you have let's say you want to write something right you want to enter a deep state of or a deep work state right is that a formula that you have to enter the deep work state for a period of 60 to 90 minutes of no distractions no no you there is it's called stillness
[SPEAKER_03]: stillness because you gotta remember our bodies and minds are constantly in action and for me I need to be like in a clear path in my mind like my surroundings what I'm looking at sometimes I'll actually
[SPEAKER_03]: actually have a pad in my car.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if I'm driving and I feel a certain mood, I literally will pull over to the side, maybe go to like a parking, uh, parking lot, or even a park.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because when I have this feelings, when I have these thoughts in my mind, and I think it's going to bring value, not just in my life, but other areas.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I like to chat it down.
[SPEAKER_03]: I write it down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I think about it and then how it made me feel.
[SPEAKER_03]: So those are the three things, like what is my thought, where did I get there, and then how it makes me feel.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what's happening right now when it comes to energies.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, Will, you know this, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: What you put out in the universe is what you're going to get back.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what's happening to me right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: When people see me, it's a transformation.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like, well, Nino, I want to be like you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not making this about me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just letting you guys know what's happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's not just a physical state.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the spirit, the energy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because people will tell me, Nino, the way you talk, the way, because they know me, a matter of fact, today,
[SPEAKER_03]: is from the anniversary of four years being on this platform.
[SPEAKER_03]: I came here right in the middle of COVID.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you look at my profile, I was out of shape.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was not motivated.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had the world got the best of me.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then when COVID hit,
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I have more time once again, you know, you asked me that question, it's the stillness.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what I did was with COVID, it kind of was a blessing in disguise for me because I have more time to do me, uh, do the corrections that I needed to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what I'm going to, I don't tell people what to do, but if you're looking for personal growth and you're looking to better your life, be in that stillness.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then for me was to write down.
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, the issues that I was having.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when it comes to, you know, like right now I'm, I'm, I'm putting together like newsletters.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got people helping me with the website because they believe in me, but also being aligned with the right people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because when you get into this state of thought, sometimes, you know, certain people will leave your life because they're, they're not in the same brain plane as yourself, you know, when it comes to like leveling up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, so,
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, just be in the stillness and then whatever you're feeling, like just write that down, especially if it's a good feeling, because you kind of want to capture that for the rest of your days, weeks, love, and the rest of your life.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, the stillness.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great points there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to mention to people out there that stillness can be also achieved through movement.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't necessarily mean that you have to completely sit down and meditate, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can go on a run and enter a flow state.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can write and enter a flow state, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for those points, Nino.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to, I think I saw Will's hand up.
[SPEAKER_06]: uh did you have yeah it is up yeah it's not up on my phone anymore so that's right but over to you will i'll jump in real quick because you have to run in a second but you know made a couple of amazing points that i just want to compound on real quick so first of all i'll just touch on that last one right stillness is not necessarily physical stillness it's stillness from effort
[SPEAKER_06]: Because here's the thing, which is a deeper psychological aspect of this, which most people actually never, never understand.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when I really got this, it kind of twisted my worldview around a bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: When you're trying to get something, you're implying you don't have it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Simple as that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying to get, for example, I'm trying to get my business, trying to get more money, trying to get more health, trying to get more whatever, because I don't have it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when you're in that state of, I don't have it,
[SPEAKER_06]: That is all the brain is listening to.
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, the brain is very simple.
[SPEAKER_06]: I am, or I am not.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a reason that God's name is I am, that I am, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Who should I tell if He sent you?
[SPEAKER_06]: I am that I am has sent you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yade Vahe, Jehovah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It means I see, therefore I am.
[SPEAKER_06]: The idea that if I want to be something, I must go through all these hoops to get it, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Physically, makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_06]: Really logical.
[SPEAKER_06]: The rational mind loves this.
[SPEAKER_06]: I am directly implying I don't have it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if I put success off to the future and say, I will be happy when I have X amount of money, when I have this house, when I have this thing, I am directly implying that I am not happy now.
[SPEAKER_06]: I am not wealthy now.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the brain goes, oh, you're not happy.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're not wealthy because it only understands I am.
[SPEAKER_06]: You are sad.
[SPEAKER_06]: You are poor.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what you're focusing on, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: This is wild.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is what you're focusing on.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is what it is programmed to look for.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is what you will create more of.
[SPEAKER_06]: Simple psychology, simple biology, no religion needed, no spirituality needed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now the spiritual aspect of this is the understanding that you can put your mind on things above, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: You can take that beautiful awareness that does not require the world to be different.
[SPEAKER_06]: As an example, right now you probably have a car, you probably have some possessions that are not in your direct line of sight, you know they're there.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're not worried about them not being there because you can't see them.
[SPEAKER_06]: That exact same thing can be used on the things you want.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can place it there.
[SPEAKER_06]: The only thing that would hold them apart from that is you to say, oh, that's not real.
[SPEAKER_06]: The brain's always listening.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the idea here is the cessation of effort is not laziness.
[SPEAKER_06]: I do not promote laziness.
[SPEAKER_06]: You will likely take massive action, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: You very likely will.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it comes from a position that I already have it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is why it's said in so many ways, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Letting go, detachment.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the detachment from the outcome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let go and let God is another way of saying this.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have set my direction and I trust the path to unfold to me.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the cessation of effort means you don't strive from lack anymore, you strive from having.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have this, therefore I am this, therefore I'll walk in that direction.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I see this with entrepreneurs all the time.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've talked about it, I'm sure, VB, before, but like if someone says, I'm an aspiring entrepreneur, I'll be an entrepreneur when?
[SPEAKER_06]: You're directly implying you're not an entrepreneur now, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Directly.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that will never be your truth.
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll never live that because your brain goes, oh, I'm not an entrepreneur.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a wantrepreneur.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a, I'm a,
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying to be, I'm an amateur, I'm beginning.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that's all it can produce, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So when we understand that it must be as within, so without, the state must be primary and the state requires no physical exchange, you can then rest from the cessation of effort of trying to get it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you're like, okay, I am a writer.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not trying to get being a writer.
[SPEAKER_06]: I am successful.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not trying to get successful.
[SPEAKER_06]: I am still.
[SPEAKER_06]: And from that stillness, the action then flows.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I am a writer, I'm gonna write.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I'm a business owner, I'm gonna make offers.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, that's as within, so without.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the first point, and Nina was spot on with that.
[SPEAKER_06]: To be still is to be still from the effort, the desire, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's nothing wrong with desire, I wanna add this in, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: The word actually means desire of the father.
[SPEAKER_06]: And intuition is a beautiful way of saying this, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because intuition, if you break it down, is inner tuition, it's inner learning.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the only way you can get that is to be still.
[SPEAKER_06]: You get those inner nudges, the small, still voice, as it's called, or the still small voice, I forget the way it's said, but the voice within.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what that does is it outpictures your identity or your self-concept.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when you have an idea of who you are, your internal
[SPEAKER_06]: actions and your external actions must be made congruent with that.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you look into psychology, the idea of internal congruence and dissonance is the idea that if I believe I'm a fit person and I go to the gym, I am taking a congruent action.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no resistance there.
[SPEAKER_06]: If I'm an unfit person and I go to the gym, there's a lot of resistance there because it's dissonant, it's incongruent.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the idea is you must be it before it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's why you must be still, because that is the only place you can change who you are being.
[SPEAKER_06]: And as I said before, it's spiritual first, the being, then it's mental, the thoughts, the feelings, the emotions, then it's physical, the actions, and then you get the results, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: You need all three.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can be spiritual and mental with no action and you won't get anything.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can take all the action in the world, but unless you have the spiritual and the mental lined up, you will not produce anything.
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll just be busy, but not productive.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like you said earlier, it's the movement, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: You can walk one mile in 10 different directions and end up right where you started.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you're lined up with spiritual, mental, and physical, now you can walk 10 miles in one direction and have a result.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's the difference between someone who is busy and someone who is productive, someone who's aligned.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the thing is, right, when you're aligned in that way, you take fewer, higher leverage moves.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're guided from within.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're not trying to figure it all out yourself as a human.
[SPEAKER_06]: You realize that you're one with source and it's all done through you.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that is, yeah, you said, put it on the universe, the universe brings it back.
[SPEAKER_06]: I say you and source of one, I and my father are one.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I trust, I have faith that if I can hold a desire within and be disciplined and focused in the knowing that that is who I am, the true meaning of prayer, it will be done through me.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's, that's how I see it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that has changed my life completely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Will, can I, can I just, I know we don't know each other, I just came up, I gave you a follow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for so eloquently describing what, I'm not an eloquent person, but I tell my kids all the time when I ask them to do something, and they say, I'll try dad.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've always replied with,
[SPEAKER_04]: try, try implies that you have a reasonable expectation of failure.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is what I always tell them is like, don't try just do it's not about whether you do or not.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so anyway, I just came up, we can talk more if you'd like, but just thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a very eloquent way of as I've been a solopreneur for
[SPEAKER_04]: almost my whole life.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm an 80s baby.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been just on my own working for most of my professional career.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I always find it hard to describe what you just did in that internal.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I guess one little question to follow up, you were talking about
[SPEAKER_04]: And now I can't even recall how you were saying it so, so lovely, lovely.
[SPEAKER_04]: But confidence is what was coming to my head there in that having that rooted confidence so that you can start those roads.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I guess I wanted to ask for those that see the road that you just painted, the picture you painted,
[SPEAKER_04]: but lack the confidence, even in the face of true understanding of all of those things, do you have a process for kickstarting that for people in that kind of mindset?
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: Vivi, if you're happy for me to, I'll share another few minutes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Please.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love what's happening here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Please go ahead.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, yes, this is kind of my specialty at the moment, right, which is I like to call it an unshakable self concept.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is the idea that no matter what happens outside of me, I can remain unshaken within me.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the basics of this is to understand that nothing out there is inherently meaningful.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't mean that in a nihilistic way.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean that nothing outside of you has an intrinsic meaning.
[SPEAKER_06]: Things can happen and you can choose the meaning that you give them.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I define confidence in one of two ways.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's external confidence and internal confidence.
[SPEAKER_06]: External confidence is perceived likelihood of changing the outcome or predicting the outcome is another way of saying it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And my good friend, Andy, in one of his spaces, we had a great conversation about this.
[SPEAKER_06]: gave the example of if you've baked 15 cakes before you've got a pretty good degree of external confidence that you can bake a 16th cake because you've got a good understanding of the process and a high degree of being able to predict or control the outcome.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's external confidence, that's skill, that's we'll call it the ability to
[SPEAKER_06]: do things in a way that you can predict, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's necessary, especially in business, you must have your skills, you must have a reasonable understanding of what you're doing, and a good understanding of whether an outcome is likely or not.
[SPEAKER_06]: But internal confidence, which is what I specialize in, is deeper.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is the ability to know that no matter what happens outside of me,
[SPEAKER_06]: I have 100%, I call it sovereignty, over my internal state.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the world could fall down around me, but I can still remain unmoved.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I do that by realizing that nothing outside of me has an external, it's not inherently meaningful.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'll give you an example, right, from the world of entrepreneurship.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's say you pitch someone for your services, and they look like they're interested, you go through all the back and forth, and then they say, thanks, but no thanks at the end, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So you didn't make the sale.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is not inherently a bad thing and it's not inherently a good thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what I try and get people to see is that's data.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's purely data, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: That is just the objective and I say objective loosely because everyone is objectively correct in their subjective reality.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the idea here is that is what happened.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now that is not in your control.
[SPEAKER_06]: The external world is not in our control, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: That is outside, outside of our locus of control.
[SPEAKER_06]: However.
[SPEAKER_06]: you have 100% responsibility and control for everything that goes within you.
[SPEAKER_06]: And just a quick question, Derek, have you heard of Viktor Frankl?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, sir.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: He wrote an amazing book.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll give it the real short version called Man's Search for Meaning.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he was a prisoner in a World War II concentration camp.
[SPEAKER_06]: He went through the worst of it, had to bury his family.
[SPEAKER_06]: He went through things that would have broken almost anybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he realized in that process going through that, that no one outside of him could change the way he thought about things.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, it was the worst scenario you can realistically imagine, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: And he realized that he had total sovereignty over his internal state.
[SPEAKER_06]: So he went on to become an author, and I think he was a psychologist for a while as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the idea here is that confidence comes from understanding that no matter what happens outside of me,
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't allow it to change my internal state.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because when you understand that all it's really in our control is our state of being, the state we're in, the identity that we have, then we understand that that controls the way we perceive the world.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'll give you an example.
[SPEAKER_06]: If I am an entrepreneur and I believe in my product, the things are going pretty well, but I have two or three clients that don't buy from me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: The way that the externally focused person will act is they will say, this means there is something wrong with me.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they'll take an objective, neutral fact, and they'll assign the meaning about themselves.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is human nature.
[SPEAKER_06]: We are here for pattern recognition and threat assessment, if you want to put it in that way.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they'll try and say, well, what's the problem?
[SPEAKER_06]: When you zoom out, it could just be that those three clients, for whatever reason, weren't the right ones for you.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the 10 before and the 10 after will be.
[SPEAKER_06]: Unshakable self-concept, unshakable self-confidence means no matter what goes on without me, I don't bring it inside.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't bring it to heaven, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: I remain in my chosen state no matter what.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is so powerful because now you have full control.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every day when you wake up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_04]: You would go through ebbs and flows that would feel out of your control.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, they're 100%.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there always will be external events out of our control.
[SPEAKER_06]: For every up, there is a down, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the law of rhythm.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you would feel effective versus where you're saying having, you know, that mindset first, then it's less impactful, or at least on your terms.
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is where the confidence comes from, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's to realize that nothing outside of me can shake me without my permission.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to consent.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it takes a degree, I will be completely transparent, it takes a degree of awareness and discipline to not get sucked into this, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're a gamer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Would it also take a degree, sorry to interrupt, would it also take a degree of being torn down?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, part of life is going through the rough stuff because we learn more about ourselves and capabilities.
[SPEAKER_04]: So would that be, I guess, an ingredient, almost necessity in the mixture?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's definitely an ingredient, not a necessity, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: What that will do, what that will do for you is it will give you tangential experience, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: And one of the great things about humanity is that we have the ability to endure something and then choose what it meant, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: No other animal can do this.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when we experience something, let's say you're in a car crash or God forbid anything does happen, but let's say you're in a situation that is unpleasant.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can choose in the moment, if you have the awareness, which is the missing ingredient for most people, you can choose exactly how you respond instead of react.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can say this thing happened and then you can immediately say, that's good.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then look for the good in it.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is from Jocko Willink.
[SPEAKER_06]: I heard it first from Jack Canfield, but it's like, that's good.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's my default response.
[SPEAKER_06]: Where's the good.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what my brain is now looking for.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or you can spiral into, this is the bad.
[SPEAKER_06]: And go ahead, I want to answer your question first.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and I don't mean to interrupt and I actually have to get going I have my own show is starting in 15 minutes but I'd like to talk to you more.
[SPEAKER_04]: I won't get into my own personal experience everybody's has their own thing but I've been.
[SPEAKER_04]: at the highest of highs and the lowest of lows than many of us.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I felt this ebbs and flows.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have all of both, but at different times in my life.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have the awareness through it all.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've not been able to grasp the two sides of that equation at the same time to fuse them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of want to
[SPEAKER_04]: I see you've got a school site.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll go check out what you have offering, but I'll let you go here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe other questions that come, I have to run, but I wanted to say thank you, because I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's people come into people's lives at a certain time, a certain way, and I don't think it's coincidence that I've run into you today.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to reach out if you don't mind, and I'll check your schedule, and we'll talk more.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're very welcome.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll finish the thought just for everyone else in the room as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: But thank you, Eric.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's good to meet you.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the idea here now is once you understand that life will have its ups and downs, life will have its ebbs and flows, that there is a law of rhythm, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oscillation.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can keep the same frequency, you can keep the same identity, but there is always ups and downs in a frequency.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's how it works.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you can remain unmoved by the external events.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when you are doing this, you are now what I call sovereign.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right?
[SPEAKER_06]: You are in control of you.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I will say that this is a discipline.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a practice.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a daily practice.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you can say, okay, I didn't learn that customer.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_06]: What does it teach me?
[SPEAKER_06]: What does it show me?
[SPEAKER_06]: Where's my opportunity?
[SPEAKER_06]: Or you could descend into the sort of patent reactive mode, which is where I didn't get a client.
[SPEAKER_06]: Another one.
[SPEAKER_06]: This means this about me.
[SPEAKER_06]: This means this about me.
[SPEAKER_06]: None of that is true.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is simply a patent survival, um, egoic technique.
[SPEAKER_06]: where your ego will relate what has happened to you in order to predict it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Your brain is literally a forecast machine.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you have a failure, it is going to say, okay, I had a failure last time.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's likely I'm going to have a failure again next time.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then when it happens, it reinforces the identity and now it's self-perpetuating.
[SPEAKER_06]: You break that by saying, I am, I'll just go back to the Bible again.
[SPEAKER_06]: I am that I am no matter what I am successful, no matter what.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if the bad thing happens, you say, okay, great.
[SPEAKER_06]: What does this teach me?
[SPEAKER_06]: How does this make me more successful?
[SPEAKER_06]: How does this reinforce my new chosen identity?
[SPEAKER_06]: You have that ability.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know it seems hard, but you have that ability.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is the practice of unshakable self-concept.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that is how you build confidence that is not just externally based, because that's built on sand, that's temporary, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: You build it on rock.
[SPEAKER_06]: You build it on I am that I am no matter what.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, it doesn't matter what the world throws at you, because your self-concept has changed.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that actually changes how you see the world.
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, Vivi, I've got to run, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got a thing at one o'clock.
[SPEAKER_06]: But man, I can get on the ramp with these things.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I absolutely love it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And thanks for having me up as a speaker, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank you for sharing your points.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that was absolutely that was exactly what I want from my spaces as well, where people can just connect with each other and possibly have a chance to collaborate.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was wonderful to see.
[SPEAKER_02]: And thanks for your points.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, articulated guys, we are kind of on a
[SPEAKER_02]: Even I got a run in about five to 10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have a couple of hands.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to go through the hands first, real quick, and then we can wrap up the space.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll revisit whatever we discussed in the space.
[SPEAKER_02]: As I promised, by the end of the space, we will revisit whatever we discussed in the space.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for the people who have just joined in, by the way,
[SPEAKER_02]: feel free to go through the jumbotron what we discussed about deep work it's written in a thread you don't have to read it right now you can bookmark it and save it for later as well as you can bookmark it and then put it on your chat gpt and firstly ask gpt to
[SPEAKER_02]: I just summarize this entire thing for you so that you can use it for your own work or number two just implement it in your work.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, you may see fit.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one benefit that I see in terms of how you can use your AI to implement frameworks guys and this is a this is a framework right there, but let's move to
[SPEAKER_02]: Tiger lily's hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure if I can if nino's hand was up because I don't see it on my phone But I think I saw it for a moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's tiger and then me I'm gonna keep my short because pretty soon I have to leave but yeah, go ahead tiger.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, good morning, and thank you so very much for this space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did hear Nino speak for the first time yesterday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Incredible pitching.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Will, thank you again for all that you've elucidated on this space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll keep it brief.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're trying to close it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I too am an entrepreneur.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work in non-profit, somewhat similar to Nino.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in not necessarily health and wellness, but more medical survivorship.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess my question is, do either of you confront a bit of the obstacle of credentialism?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason why I ask is I have a background and an education formally in business, a master's degree in business.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in light of what I'm pursuing now with patients in hospitals and institutions, I'm coming now from kind of more of a life coaching perspective where patients are seeking my help in light of my medical survival, things that I survived.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similar somewhat to Nino.
[SPEAKER_00]: position of hardship and demoralization and just a point where you're just not certain if you can go forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then life has a beautiful way about it where it takes a turn and you develop a new perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I just want to thank you so much for the space, the host, and Nino and Will.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pleasure to meet both of you, hear you on this space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the positivity, the encouragement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for letting me speak this morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank you for your questions, Tiger.
[SPEAKER_02]: And thanks for joining the space and your kind words.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, over to you, Will or Nino, any one of you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you guys hear me?
[SPEAKER_02]: Loud and clear, Nino.
[SPEAKER_04]: Over to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can hear you Nino.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oops seems like he was ragging a bit so I think he'll join in once again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is Will still around?
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, yep, still here just doing a bit of work preparing for my one o'clock.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_06]: I can do some closing thoughts if you like.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Tiger had a couple of questions for either you or Nino.
[SPEAKER_02]: Were you able to catch her questions?
[SPEAKER_06]: I did catch a little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice to meet you, Taga, by the way.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're talking about credentialism.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm a hypnotherapist by sort of grade these days, you could say, but a mortgage manager before that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I've never worked in the medical industry as such.
[SPEAKER_06]: But what I would say is,
[SPEAKER_06]: My general advice to business owners is proof of a promise, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Always proof of a promise.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you're in the life coaching space, which I'm getting pulled towards more and more, not where I wanted to go or intended to go, but it's such a beautiful and powerful place to help people with that really my credentials, as it were, are the people I've helped so far.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I probably won't be able to speak to the medical side of things I do apologize I've just never been in that world, but in terms of coaching and and helping people with the major outcomes that I help them with.
[SPEAKER_06]: way I like to position it is I speak my philosophy wherever I go, as you probably noticed.
[SPEAKER_06]: But then the people who want to work with me, I'm just like, well, these are the people I've helped before.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I learned a lot of this from one of my mentors, Justin, who's another host here inside the startup circle.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, it's just the idea of
[SPEAKER_06]: People are looking for an outcome of security, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Typically speaking, if you're marketing to entrepreneurs, if you're marketing to people who are in a state where they need some guidance and support, what they're looking for is stability.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're looking for security.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're looking for a high likelihood of the outcome.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the more that we can show them that I have helped people just like you get these results, it bridges the gap like nothing else.
[SPEAKER_06]: And in the world we live in today where anyone can say anything,
[SPEAKER_06]: Roof really does speak far louder than promise.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's kind of like one of my core philosophies.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you're starting out, and again, I'm not sure where you are in the journey, but it sounds like you're quite established from what I heard there.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you are looking to move more in that industry, in a world where that is not a regulated space, so we don't have credentials that we can put out there, like I'm a hypnotherapist, I can show people, nobody typically has cared, but
[SPEAKER_06]: It all comes down to how good you are at actually getting people into that state where now they feel they're in control of their life.
[SPEAKER_06]: They have a bit more of that internal direction.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's probably the best way I could answer it right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, sorry on the medical side, I just don't have the experience, but for the coaching side of things, proof of a promise, speak your philosophy wherever you go.
[SPEAKER_06]: That has worked quite well for me.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, just show people that they're safe in your hands is the best way I can put it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's incredible insight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm new to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know I had this capacity, but I keep having people revisit the fact that I have quite a bit to offer in light of what I've traversed and survived.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is in the medical realm because I have doctors and scientists reaching out to me, wanting to hear about my experience, what I've learned.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your point on perhaps
[SPEAKER_00]: your previous career, and mine, I worked as a tax specialist, so I prepared tax returns.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now I'm in this realm where people are seeking the ability to kind of get past their medical situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not a physician.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't claim to be one, never have.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yet, I guess my experience and my overcoming a lot of obstacles lends to an insight that not only patients
[SPEAKER_00]: we call them survivors, are really traversing, but doctors and scientists wanting to hear more from a patient experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, thank you so much this morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for your insight and your philosophy that you shared.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't wait to hear you on more spaces, and it's a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: What I would say, just to the beautiful words you shared there, is you don't need any credentials to be you.
[SPEAKER_06]: You are the expert in you.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you're sharing your story, again, not giving medical advice to people, if you're sharing your story and you are sharing a philosophy that people could need to hear from a perspective of proof, like I lived this and I got to here, if you're living this and you want to get to here, then I could be your guide because I've gone through that valley.
[SPEAKER_06]: you don't need any medical credentials to be you.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you could lean on that side of it, because that is what people are wanting.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is that authentic.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have been where you are and now I am here.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want me to show you the path, I can.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's effectively what a coach would do.
[SPEAKER_06]: So from what you just shared, I think that that is something that you can already pursue.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, of course, if there is an avenue within the medical industry, then, of course, they'll have their own process.
[SPEAKER_06]: But
[SPEAKER_06]: Just from my experience of guiding people as a coach, and I typically work more with business owners than life coaching, although, again, that is something that I'm getting drawn to.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, just again, it's showing people that you are the guy that they feel safe with.
[SPEAKER_06]: And ultimately, that's what they're looking for.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because if they're in a position of stress and they're not happy with the way that their life is going, what they're asking for is somebody to come and show them the way.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can do that, certifications or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, your words warmed my heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're so poignant, and you're correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need the credentialism necessarily, and I'm not pretending to be such a thing, but I am my experience, and I am what I've learned and overcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you again so much, Will.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a pleasure to have you here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, host, for the space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank you for joining the space, Tiger.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a pleasure to have you here for the first time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this is the first time you joined my space.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a pleasure to have you here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much, Will, for your valuable insights as usual.
[SPEAKER_02]: The next time I will pass on the co-host thing to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you have the time, let's say you feel free to jump as a co-host.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now I would like to, I am getting a couple of requests to join the speaker panel.
[SPEAKER_02]: My friends, I'm so sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will be shutting the space down in five minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to use the five minutes to recap the entire space that we took so far.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is getting late here in India for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I would like to close with, let's say, a couple of quotes from Cal Newport, where
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, this is very profound, right, what Calvin Newport says.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see Nino has joined in once again.
[SPEAKER_02]: He says, when Carl Jung wanted to revolutionize the field of psychiatry, he built a retreat in the woods.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jung's Bollingen Tower became a place where he could maintain his ability to think deeply and then apply the skill to produce work of such stunning originality that it changed the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he says in the pages ahead, I'll try to convince you to join me in the effort to build our own personal Bollingen Towers to cultivate an ability to produce real value in an increasingly distracted world and to recognize a truth embraced by the most productive and important personalities of generations past.
[SPEAKER_02]: A deep life is a good life.
[SPEAKER_02]: And guys, I am building my Bollingen Tower.
[SPEAKER_02]: not out of stone that Carl Jung built in the woods, but out of systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is what you could do as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see Nino is looking to join in the speaker section.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to hear from him.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he's here to answer your questions, Tiger.
[SPEAKER_02]: So pull him to the speaker section for a bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So guys I'm building my bowling in tower not out of stone not in the woods but out of simple systems right 60 to 90 minute work blocks phone off one task deep focus I'm using this to build a $4.99 product in
[SPEAKER_02]: 47 days, that is next month.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm using it to help validation clients extract frameworks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm using it to create threads that is worth reading.
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of threads, guys, for people who are just joining in and want to learn more about the deep work and the things that we are talking about, I've written a thread about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's on the Jumbotron.
[SPEAKER_02]: Feel free to number one, you don't have to read it right away.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can bookmark it and then
[SPEAKER_02]: upload the same thing on your AI and ask it to distill it for you or apply in your current project that's what I do when I get a framework interesting framework I simply copy that entire thing and apply it to my I don't use GPT anymore I use cloud so apply it to cloud and be like
[SPEAKER_02]: How do I apply this to my current project that I'm working on?
[SPEAKER_02]: And usually I find out a lot of things that I kind of wouldn't have an idea about.
[SPEAKER_02]: So.
[SPEAKER_02]: Use systems and I'm I'm using 1690 blocks, you can do the same tomorrow morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: 60 to 90 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually I say morning just like that because I do it in the mornings and I feel it's easiest at 5 a.m 6 a.m types rather than 5 p.m or 6 p.m because your brain is not the same as it is and your brain state in the morning is different from the brain state in the evening.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't
[SPEAKER_02]: project the same kind of creativity that you could, let's say, before a lot of stressful work and after a lot of stressful work.
[SPEAKER_02]: So start building.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guys, I want to quickly move on to Nino right now, if he has any final thoughts or if he wants to respond to Tiger's questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, how's it going?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so I'm going to just keep this short.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did get a, I lost a connection here, but I wanted to get back to, um, tiger.
[SPEAKER_03]: So tiger, uh, when it comes to, you know, what you're trying to achieve and you're in kind of, uh, what happened to me, I used to be in corporate and now I'm doing the life coaching.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to reach out to me, uh, I can show you some of the programs that's available, which is going to lead you to the ICF, which is the gold standard.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is hilarious.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Multitasking.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but yeah, you know, and here's the thing is whatever you want to achieve in your life, uh, just, you know, that 1%, that's what works for me is, uh, whatever changes I want to make, uh, surround yourself with the people that are already in that field.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it might take you three months, six months, a year, but at least you're going towards something that you're passionate about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, me working at the medical wellness clinic, I get an opportunity to help people.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the biggest thing for me is the right people start coming towards you.
[SPEAKER_03]: when you're putting out the right energies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once again, it's what you put out there is what you're going to receive.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the only way that works, you kind of have to expose yourself a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, which I don't have a problem with that being that I'm a hundred percent Italian and I didn't have a choice, but yeah, I'm here to help people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, this is why I'm in this space here and now we're not even talking about monetizing, but eventually that's what I want to do, uh, which I'm doing right now, monetizing so I can do this full time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, so just going after my own dreams, but yeah, tiger, if you want to know a little bit more, just send me a DM and, uh, you know, we can have a conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And thank you for this space.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, let me know next time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Send me a DM.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: No problem, Nino.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you forgot my name.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to call me Vaibhav.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can call me VB.
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand it's been a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: VB?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, I will definitely check you up on that offer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will send you a DM if I'm hosting such kind of a space.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm kind of hosting four to five times a week these days.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what my system allows me to.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's not quite necessary on such a topic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tomorrow I'm going to be talking a little bit about the business aspect of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today was a little bit about deep work.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll still send you a DM if you feel interested, feel free to join in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Build your own Bollingen Tower, not out of stone, but out of systems like we discussed earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: 60 to 90 minute work blocks.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can have up to three work blocks per day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to say a quick hi to Jodell as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jodell, thanks for joining this space.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just going to be shutting this down, but it's nice to have you here.
[SPEAKER_02]: but yeah 60 to 90 minute work blocks my friends your phone absolutely of one task focus on the one task deep focus i'm currently using it to build my product which is in about 47 days i'm using it to help clients to extract frameworks i'm using it to create threads that is that are kind of worth reading and bookmarking bookmark worthy and you can do the same guys
[SPEAKER_02]: tomorrow morning 60 to 90 minutes one task start off slow one task phone off start building your tower it's going to be hard the first week the second week but it will get easier guys it does get easier trust me it's going to be very hard for you to sit down and meditate right away if you've never meditated in your life but if you keep doing it it gets easier and easier and easier it does get hard it is hard
[SPEAKER_02]: but it gets easier only through practice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Focus is a muscle that you have to build.
[SPEAKER_02]: A couple of quotes that we discussed earlier in the space which I want to bring back right now before I quit, I mean before I close the space is number one, what is deep work?
[SPEAKER_02]: Deep work means
[SPEAKER_02]: professional activities that are performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that put or push your cognitive abilities to their limit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to push your cognitive abilities to your limit and you cannot do that when you are distracted even for a second by let's say a notification from your phone.
[SPEAKER_02]: We discussed how
[SPEAKER_02]: every distraction that you get even for a minute it takes you about 13 to 23 minutes to get back and refocus you might be imagining and get getting close to a breakthrough and boom one notification you get distracted you respond to that engagement and you forgot where the hell you were what kind of breakthrough were you even talking about right so do not um
[SPEAKER_02]: put your phone off in airplane mode or flight mode whatever you call it in D&D.
[SPEAKER_02]: I put my phone on D&D.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't get succumbed to pulling out your phone and just doing it for a couple of minutes because those couple of minutes are going to ruin 20 minutes of your productivity.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is what deep work is.
[SPEAKER_02]: The deep work hypothesis is the ability to perform deep work
[SPEAKER_02]: is actually becoming increasingly rare at exactly the same time it is becoming increasingly valuable in our economy guys the more rare things get the more valuable it gets because in a distracted world these days the ability to focus is extremely rare and if you can do it you can actually stand out you can actually build something great so this is an important topic three to four hours a day
[SPEAKER_02]: five days a week or six days a week of uninterrupted and carefully directed concentration.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uninterrupted and carefully directed concentration, it turns out, can produce a lot of valuable output.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never been close to a breakthrough, guys, like this, and I would recommend you all to follow this.
[SPEAKER_02]: A deep life is a good life.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to end this and
[SPEAKER_02]: and the space over here.

[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, thank you all for being here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you everybody for joining in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will be hosting the space tomorrow as well on a slightly different topic.
[SPEAKER_02]: We will be talking a little bit more on business aspects of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking forward to seeing you all tomorrow.
