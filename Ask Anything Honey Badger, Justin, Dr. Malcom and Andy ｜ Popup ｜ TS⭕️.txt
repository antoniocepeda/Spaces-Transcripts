[SPEAKER_00]: Not much is happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, there we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, Honey Badger.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, Andy.
[SPEAKER_06]: So good to see you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry I've been in absentia, but I've been extremely busy.
[SPEAKER_06]: And as a matter of fact, I'm out of town right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm in San Diego.
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of you know doing some stuff and so I don't want to get into all the details So but yeah, like literally every time you open your space at noon I've had to be addressing something very important and it's always a bummer to miss your spaces But hey, you know, I love the pop-up like impromptu.
[SPEAKER_06]: How you doing Andy?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm good.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got I
[SPEAKER_00]: Justin and I were just talking, we usually, we talk daily most of the time, and he goes, why don't you just start a space and we'll talk about this stuff live?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Dr. Malcolm, what's going on?
[SPEAKER_02]: Honey Badger, did you say you're in San Diego right now?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, sir, in downtown.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been here for three days.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've got a lot of business to do here.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just, it's exhausting.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just, it's like,
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, well, if you get some time and you want to do a B-Roll X-Talk show, you know, let me know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll see what I can do.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, like, I'd love to get you on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: But wait a second, like, you're here in San Diego?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I live in San Diego.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what's precluding me from getting on, like, like doing the podcast with you?
[SPEAKER_06]: At any rate, like, even if I was in Phoenix right now?
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, like, you know, okay, so I know
[SPEAKER_00]: You want me to come in studio?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, it's they do it in a model x tesla drives around and the cameras are on Yeah Of course I mean maybe we can make it happen tomorrow Thursday Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, see if I can arrange that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I I guess like i'm leaving tomorrow, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: So it like I I didn't I like
[SPEAKER_06]: Justin, if I would have had any idea, I would have reached out to you on Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I didn't know you were in San Diego or I would have hooked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have said, Hey, you need to talk to Justin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to say hook you guys up, but that isn't right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not the right thing to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Connect you guys together.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where you're going.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was posting about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: As a matter of fact, here's my evidence on Sunday night, I sent out a post about like just being in San Diego and maybe
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys need to put me on notice I Book up quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just saying you know oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's funny In the replies trying to coordinate with you because yeah like I've I
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm in San Diego.
[SPEAKER_02]: I live in San Diego.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm born and raised.
[SPEAKER_02]: And anyone that is from X that says, hey, I'm coming to San Diego, they let me know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to get them on the show, of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, we'll try to set it up for next time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little late notice to book my driver, because I have a driver.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just telling you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm telling you as a friend.
[SPEAKER_06]: I posted twice about coming to San Diego.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the first part was,
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, like seeing my, I'm here visiting my niece as well because she lives here, but I'm just saying, you know, I, I just put them up and like one got 34 K impressions.
[SPEAKER_06]: The other one got like almost 3000.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's not a slouch.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe, maybe you just have to have me on notifications.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I said, I book up fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh,
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm just disappointed.
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought I was on your notification.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just saying I'm a little disappointed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, in all honesty, I got a new client.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what happened was...
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not mad at you.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're just going to troll him now, nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Troll away.
Troll away.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I get no enjoyment out of it because basically, I mean, that was your loss.
[SPEAKER_06]: So why would I...
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's weird.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like punching down.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's like we could have hooked up.
[SPEAKER_06]: We could have we could have made beautiful music together.
[SPEAKER_06]: We could have been the next.
[SPEAKER_06]: What is a taxi cab confession?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I should say, you know, I should say Tesla, Tesla confession, but I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got you got to keep up, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Andy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, man, I'm blowing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could have had Honey Badger on the show tomorrow, you know, and yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, well, hey, we're all together now, that's what matters, and yeah, please, I'm gonna have to turn notifications on for Honey Badger now, so that's my takeaway, that's my action item, so.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know, here's the way you can make it up, okay?
[SPEAKER_06]: This is just a suggestion, but I think it's a great suggestion, but it's just a suggestion.
[SPEAKER_06]: Why don't you travel your Tesla down to Phoenix?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a very quick drive.
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, it's like five hours.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not hard.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's, and it's kind of lovely depending on when you drive.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I would recommend at night when the, like at dusk, because you go through the desert a lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so it's very beautiful if you're like going like six or 7 PM, like daylight savings time.
[SPEAKER_06]: But, but point being, you come down to Phoenix and we can do it from there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or I'll come back.
[SPEAKER_06]: You actually, you know, okay, I'm coming back Thanksgiving, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm coming, yeah, I'm coming back in a month.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we can plan that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: We will definitely plan that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Andy, maybe you'll come down for Thanksgiving to see your family in Carlsbad, and then we can do all three of us on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll see what I can do.
[SPEAKER_06]: Andy, come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I have other family and other Thanksgiving things that happen at Thanksgiving.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_05]: But my sister... What's more important, Andy?
[SPEAKER_05]: Me and Justin or your family?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're on a troll roll.
[SPEAKER_00]: My God.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seriously.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holy mackerel.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my goodness.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably about equal at this point about about equal I See Christelle has joined us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Malcolm, how you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't talked to you for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going on, bud?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey brother doing great Super excited and stressed out about this
[SPEAKER_01]: Next, I want to say seven business day stretch.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to market with IBM with this AI agent.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about to be out there for the populace to find utility in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell everybody about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things I noticed is
[SPEAKER_01]: like with government contracting, when the federal government shut down, people just forgot that, you know, local opportunities and state opportunities existed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a lot of states that you can be a vendor for, you know, especially like the open states like Texas, you know, so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, why don't you just
[SPEAKER_01]: use AI to find opportunities, and I was like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have my hands in this, you know, agentic stack that IBM has.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me see how they feel about me integrating some of their technology to work with, you know, a platform and a dashboard and all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I built it, and they were like, ooh, this is nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Love the UI.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I went to Orlando to their conference for Tech Exchange, and I met the inventor of Watson X Orchestra.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wonderful, wonderful human being.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he asked me, he was like, do you have real time?
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's Chinese, so he didn't really speak a ton of English, but
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, I'm working on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was like, don't bother.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll get you real time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I finished the service broker, got that updated, did all the domain mappings for the custom domain that I wanted to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you know you don't want that long ass URL for people to log into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's for good use.
[SPEAKER_01]: It exports.
[SPEAKER_01]: files you can upload uh packages it helps with you know bid creation so there's like a bid assistance uh function or feature rather and then of course there's a dashboard because if you don't have a crm you can't measure your progress and uh how you're doing and uh we're just working like it's not necessary but what i want to do is uh create a way for people
[SPEAKER_01]: to streamline their transactions just so that like, you know how Bank of America will give you QuickBooks for free and you can just create your invoices from there to where they can do that without worrying about us having their banking information.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm looking for the bypass and then providing any direct banking information into the platform.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there's a few workarounds, but I'm probably going to end up working with like a third party to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I love partnerships, so.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I just got a note, Wells Fargo and Chase are both coming out with a new, I don't know exactly what they're doing, but their cards are offering a way to check out where you can link to their, whatever their service is called, each one of them is called a different thing, but it allows you to get payment without putting in the card information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I just started getting notes on this and I haven't seen exactly what it works, but it seems like it's a, it's some kind of wrapper that goes on top of your card account.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you have like a Pays account, could be, you know, similar to a PayPal or, you know, Venmo or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now the big banks are doing the same thing so that you can take payments without taking part in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were already doing those virtual cards, so I don't even know why they wouldn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's different information for the virtual card than your actual physical card.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But hey, man, they're big on if it ain't broke, break it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it isn't broke, figure out a way to charge more for something different.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's create a problem to solve and then charge people for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know the one that's Ma Bell.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was a famous for that, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you want a second account?
[SPEAKER_00]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like $50 more a month and it literally is an entry in a database.
[SPEAKER_01]: That initial AI solution that I started building last year for agriculture, they're supporting that as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: They gave me a direct embedded solutions agreement so I can work with
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold on, let me send you this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have your number.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, I just got reached out to from someone with the technology that I'm integrating there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They wanted my expertise.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that last thing that I sent you, that one, that last picture goes with this that happened yesterday, today-ish.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm definitely going to tap the shoulder of a partner that I have in the Netherlands to help out with this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of you guys who don't know, Dr. Malcolm is a stud in the world of economics and agriculture and technology and helping people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, full on, I don't say this lightly, like, dude is the bomb.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is, he is all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't know him, if you don't follow him, if you don't have any engagement, you got to figure out how to connect with him and find his stuff because he really, he's, he's been ahead of, like, this is like the third or fourth time that he's ahead of what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you guys definitely need to follow him.
[SPEAKER_00]: connect with him because he's now you're you're in Atlanta, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or that area?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, that's what I meant in the greater Atlanta area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm in the greater Sacramento area.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, anyway, the East Coast time, all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, he's, you definitely need to hook up and connect with I said that twice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I'm gonna have to change my my language.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna have to find a way to connect with Dr. Malcolm because he's really, he's really that
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so Justin and I were talking about marketing and tell everybody what you were talking to me about Google Business Services or your Google Business page.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, so yeah, like if you have a local service business like plumbing,
[SPEAKER_02]: electrician, you know, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you're not leveraging the full power of your Google, my business local listing, like you're sleeping because man, there's a lot of benefits there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and yeah, like there's a big opportunity.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, and when we're just talking about ads and the importance of Google ads and Facebook ads and yeah, like really,
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, AI now, like showing up in the search results for AI, like that's definitely a big trend right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, still people are searching Google for solutions to their problems, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Plumbing, electrician, you know, fill in the blank.
[SPEAKER_02]: So any type of home service business, like as a pro tip for everyone out there is just get your Google My Business local profile set up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And don't sleep on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a big opportunity.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, good to see you, Dr. Malcolm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Always great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been on a few calls with Dr. Malcolm and his team.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, definitely great guy, great individual, great team.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, I'm just doing a lot of fractional CMO work right now and my agency work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, it's going good.
[SPEAKER_02]: So hopefully going to land a biotech startup here shortly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, yeah, good, good to see you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Likewise, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, earlier today I was telling Netta, I said, if Sean Charles and Netta really understood how many connections that they have facilitated, getting people who go on the hunt, who listen, who just show up to help.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the back channel kind of make connections and talk to each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean that's how the whole startup circle started.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because Kevin and Timo and me and Justin kind of all started talking to each other in the back channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Kevin started off with the startup circle and we just kind of jumped on the bandwagon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's very good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how me and Dr. Malcolm got connected up because of Netta, you know, Netta is like, hey, you need to connect with Dr. Malcolm.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, we jumped on some calls and yeah, that's, that's, I mean, space is just spaces is just the ultimate networking app, especially for, you know, B2B and, and connections.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, it's like, it's direct access to like decision makers.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the biggest thing people underestimate, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like typically,
[SPEAKER_02]: You would have to go through a lot of gatekeepers to reach the highest level and the decision makers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's like you're in their DMs, you know, it's like, or you have to pay $10,000 for that plate at that damn gala room with the decision makers.
[SPEAKER_00]: To eat bad food so you can sit next to them and rub shoulders, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's always, why is it that all those have such bad food?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's not, it's like, I'm paying a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't you give me some good food?
[SPEAKER_00]: For goodness sakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, that's my personal thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Google my business.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a business, if you've got a small startup solo entrepreneur business and you want to make waves, talk to Justin and he can help you get that all set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he'll show you how to take advantage of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just learning, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: My expertise is in consulting with organizations, building teams, delivering projects, getting things off the ground, managing contracts,
[SPEAKER_00]: All that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not, how do I get somebody to follow me on X or LinkedIn?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I learned that in the last two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before then, I knew nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Literally, not even, I had no academic knowledge of it at all, let alone any practical experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just flat out, Andy knows nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so with all the help of some of the folks here, I've learned just a tremendous amount and then put it in practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time, totally failed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time, totally messed it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But every now and then, you know, you hit something that makes a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so we have, but I see just the four of us on the panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the Ask Us Anything, Honey Badger, Justin, Andy,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm having a space to put Malcolm up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to put, I'm going to, I'm going to try to put you in the title there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Malcolm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put Dr. Malcolm in there too, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got, you got an all-star panel right here, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm telling you, you got your content system, personal brand, blueprint expert, Andy on the line, 30 years, 35 years plus billion dollar project manager, it, you got myself sales and marketing mastery.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got honey badger.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: A nutritionist.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nurse expert, you know X legend.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, she's she's only posted guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Listen to this.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's only posted Let me get the exact number for you She's only posted a hundred and forty nine thousand times.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think she knows quite a bit about the platform And she's been on a hundred and she's been on a hundred and forty nine thousand spaces, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I
[SPEAKER_06]: 140, okay, come on, don't get it twisted.
[SPEAKER_06]: 7,000, okay, so first of all, I post my metrics.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know why I do that, Forrest, because when I talk, obviously, you should kind of show your receipts.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, yes, I have skin in the game.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I go to the spaces dashboard, and so, full disclosure, yes, I've spoken in over 7,000 spaces,
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've hosted and co-hosted a thousand spaces.
[SPEAKER_06]: So why does that matter?
[SPEAKER_06]: It only matters through experience.
[SPEAKER_06]: And let me be clear about that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've probably made every mistake possible.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if I can save anybody else from making the same mistakes I had to kind of level up and come into a position where that sort of agency can't be taken from you, I'm happy to help.
[SPEAKER_06]: By the way, my subs are opened.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was off mute.
[SPEAKER_06]: Apologize.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of my favorite interviews with Honey Badger and Yvonne.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was like you weren't allowed to speak.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was strictly listeners only.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was when Honey Badger was interviewing the wonderful, graceful Yvonne.
[SPEAKER_02]: And man, that was such a great interview, guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me tell you this.
[SPEAKER_06]: She was the, cause I've done a lot of interviews, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I've done interviews with politicians, authors.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I don't know, like, like, like the, you know, people that have been on Tucker, you know, people that have run for office and I've interviewed a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_06]: She was by far the easiest and most enjoyable
[SPEAKER_06]: interview that I have ever done.
[SPEAKER_06]: And also guys, make sure you're praying for Yvonne.
[SPEAKER_06]: She just lost her mom, you know, but she's just an, she's just a firecracker.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, she's such, she's done so much, but, but here's the thing that I love about Yvonne too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, she doesn't have main character syndrome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_06]: She's worked in the movie, like she's worked in, like she's worked in modeling the movie industry, like front to back.
[SPEAKER_06]: And she really pretty much only supports other people.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, but she has such an incredible backstory and it's so she's just, she's just such a fun and entertaining and delightful person to speak to.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, and I mean, I just adore Yvonne.
[SPEAKER_06]: I really do.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like, I don't get to talk to everybody that I really like very much all the time.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I mean, you got to spread your love around to everybody that you like, but there's just something about Yvonne that I treasure with my whole heart.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't like, I've never had that conversation with her, but I mean, she's, she's just such a stellar human being.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, she's every time I've talked to her.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's been just top-notch And it's always fun, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: She's always makes things kind of there's something just fun about talking to her So I'd like to I'd like to get that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm gonna figure out I think like there's a few of us that like we know like we run the sort of like we know people that have Been in the entertainment industry and been fairly successful, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: um, and so
[SPEAKER_06]: you can't help but identify and compare and contrast.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, so in other words, we understand that people that are in the entertainment industry are kind of born entertainers, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: And, and that's, that's a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I, like, I love that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I, I kind of feel like that, like I just love to entertain people.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that, that resonates with me.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not, it's not about me.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's about how can I make you happier?
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we watch, like watching people that have entertained on that level.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't help but really appreciate the fact that Yvonne is really kind of mostly relegated herself to a backup singer on this platform.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm not saying that she's supposed to be there, what I'm saying is that
[SPEAKER_06]: She mostly supports everyone else and then, but then she offers her intellectual property and you know, she, she gives insight and I mean, I'm, I'm actually just like, this is free form thought right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, just, you know, I'm just thinking out loud, but these are the things that I would, I would like to articulate if, if she and I were talking right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: And as a matter of fact, I'm going to clip this and send it to her.
[SPEAKER_06]: because it really is off the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the thing I like about Yvonne is that she's willing to tell us what happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, frankly, I've never been on a movie set.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I love...
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I've always been the
[SPEAKER_00]: The behind the scene, mostly, well, I guess not always, but mostly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Andy, I'm so sorry to interrupt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_06]: I do have to jump and go pray the rosary, but the one most significant thing, as you're thinking about this, I'm sure that she has much tea to spill.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: She's been around like she's been around so she says nothing Like so so in other words like like look she's she doesn't gossip She keeps her cards close to her chest and I'm sure that like she could be like one of these people that you know Hey, I know like basically.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I've rubbed elbows with or I know this person.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm gonna tell you a story about I'm sure she has a million stories, but she I have never heard her say a bad word about
[SPEAKER_06]: about anybody that she met.
[SPEAKER_06]: As a matter of fact, she's always 100% supportive.
[SPEAKER_06]: So anyways, I do have to jump, but I'll be back.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're still writing, I'll be back in a half an hour, okay?
[SPEAKER_06]: Love you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: No worries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Annie Badger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, Christelle.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what, seven, eight o'clock at night out there in Florida.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's almost eight o'clock.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm here at the playground with Romeo.
[SPEAKER_07]: We come here every night.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: I do this to wear him out.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think of your voice in my head, Andy, about how...
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I only have one boy, but basically the goal is to wear them out so that when I go to put him to bed, he goes right to sleep.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is my new life goal every day.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I've, I were doing a new thing where I say, ready, set, go.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just have him run like that is we're just running as much as humanly possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give him a course and time him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ready?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to time you ready?
[SPEAKER_00]: Go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you were so close to breaking your record.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, you want to do it again?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because happy boys are tired boys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tired boys are happy boys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tired dogs are happy dogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Tired boys are happy mamas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what's really funny is I actually, my family's from an education family, I think I've told you that in the past, and so every now and then I'm interested in reading about things.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a study I read recently, I don't remember exactly when, the last week or so, and it basically said,
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a single-sex school, all boys school, primarily taught by men, and you just focus on educating the boys, whether I think it was a military academy or something like that, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the bottom line was that they have twice as much recess as a regular school and twice as much roughhousing, real wrestling, throw each other around.
[SPEAKER_00]: activities for that school.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember it was like one of those read, cool, got a point, next.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't really, and I can't find it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was just one of those where I was like, oh, interesting, makes sense, aligns with what I've been thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool, I'll put that in my brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I forgot to do the rest of it, which was, here's exactly where it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's exactly what we need to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's who said it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the actual school.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, the boys and dogs are kind of similar in that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Run them.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, when I was helping coach the soccer teams and the kids in martial arts or whatever, and I would give the same advice to all the coaches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what do you think we can do better?
[SPEAKER_00]: Run them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Run them until they are panting every single day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what will happen is two things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one, they'll be happier because they're able to just work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Men like to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you work hard, it gives you dopamine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different than women.
[SPEAKER_00]: When men lift weights, they get happier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just when you carry big, heavy stuff, you get happier.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you knock people down, you get happier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not because you knock people down, it's because you get dopamine from the release of the endorphins in your body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Second thing is, if you run your team more than everybody else,
[SPEAKER_00]: At some point in the season, your team can run longer, farther, faster than everybody else and you win.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just, that's the way it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I learned that when I was 15 years old swimming, where we would go to a dual meet and I was on a team with, at the time I didn't know it, but I was on the team of Hall of Fame coaches.
[SPEAKER_00]: guys that were Hall of Famers in multiple states, created championship, all American, all American Olympic caliber swimmers in every place they ever went.
[SPEAKER_00]: These were the when they were first coaches, I was on their teams.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we would go to a dual meet, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So our high school versus their high school, and we would show up an hour early and swim an entire workout, an entire workout, full
[SPEAKER_00]: workout five six thousand yard workout and then swim the meet and kick their butts and i remember when we were leaving i just happened to be right at that moment when their coach was congratulating our coach for winning and as he congratulated me said you know great job coach he goes you guys are on another level that's all he said that's all i ever heard and he walked away and
[SPEAKER_00]: I realized when you do, as a man, physically, if you do more, you're better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know any other way to make it simpler, but the point is, if you do more, you're better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have boys, I recommend that you put them on a physical regimen, make them
[SPEAKER_00]: Give them laps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make them pick up stuff before they clean their room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make them pick up and carry heavy things up and down the stairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll complain, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will complain, 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: But secretly, they love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you make them tired, they'll be happier, way happier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, go ahead, Justin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, I love this, Indy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my daughter, like, she's like,
[SPEAKER_02]: runner she's I'm teaching her tennis and like she rides her bike like she's and she's like flexing her muscles now and I'm like who's daddy the revenue road and you know like it's and it's like to Chris Christelle's point yeah it's like dude like it's it's a great age like this is such a fun age right like three four right like Romeo's three right now three yes yeah so it's like three four
[SPEAKER_02]: It's such a fun age because now it's like you can start to do things with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're picking up, like, you know, they're, they're comprehending a lot more.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're talking a lot more and it's just like, it's such a fun age.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, just enjoy every minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, and yeah, like, even though my daughter is not a boy, but she is like, man, she is very rambunctious.
[SPEAKER_02]: She likes to wrestle.
[SPEAKER_02]: She.
[SPEAKER_02]: She calls me her best friend now.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's like, Hey, best friend, you know, she's calling me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's the cutest thing ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, gosh, oh man.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I'm just enjoying every minute of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, and I want, I wanted to give Christelle the alpha that she may have missed in the beginning about Google, Google, my business local profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I totally forgot about this Christelle, but if you have a.
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, a satellite office or whatever, like an address, you may not want to use your home address, but if you have like a co-location facility, you need to use that address.
[SPEAKER_02]: As a Google, my business profile, cause there's so many benefits, not only for ads, but you know, a lot of other benefits I can share with you later, but then you put your agency down in that Miami area for the nonprofit agency.
[SPEAKER_02]: And man, I'm telling you like this, you can clean up with this, like for Legion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, this is big.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I can't believe I've been sleeping on this for here's the problem with me guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna be very honest with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like the quote of a master of the jack of all trades is a master of none.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like me.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's exactly me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm sales and marketing mastery.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: But no, like really, I have so much knowledge in all these particular areas of digital and social and SEO and content and brand and analytics and data.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can go down the list and that's the problem, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so when you become a Jack of all trades, you're a master of none.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's why part of my thing is, look, I really need to focus on, okay, what do I want to really be truly known as?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sales and marketing mastery, but like.
[SPEAKER_02]: really what is that one thing right like and this is the challenge of being an entrepreneur is we have so many jobs we have so much expertise scroll yeah exactly so yeah make sure you take take advantage of that google my business profile crystal
[SPEAKER_02]: For your co-location facility leverage that address And yeah, that's a big big alpha right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I just want to put that out there for you Yeah, we We like that It's always interesting to hear more and better stuff It's it's like what I what we're talking about earlier today is
[SPEAKER_00]: Share everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Explain it all to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some will think, oh, they're going to go do exactly what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, OK, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell you exactly how to run a project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's millions of project managers, at least hundreds of thousands of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're still not as good as me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the difference between them doing it and me doing it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't run every project in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how about this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if they steal exactly what you do, they're not exactly you, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is such a dumb example, but it's so true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ani, personal branding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kevin talking about personal branding, social media management.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking about personal branding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other people talk about... Really, you think we're competing with each other?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not competing with each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing the same thing for a different audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even if we were competing exactly the same audience, guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do I recommend?
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a target audience between 10,000 and 100,000 people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all of North America, like 10,000 people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that might be too many to target.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you targeted 10,000 people, that's 100 people a day for 100 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it, 100 people for 100 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do that three times a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can target those same 100 people for 100 days, they get you three times a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: They only get your input three times a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: 10,000 people, if you targeted 100 people a day for 100 days, that's 10,000 people, and you cycle that 10,000 people, you only talk to them three times a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so think about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If everyone's only willing to buy something at 3% when everything aligns, when they have urgency, when they have need, and they have money, guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're only getting roughly 3% interest each day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Add it up, you end up with less than, less than 1,000 people of the 10,000
[SPEAKER_00]: are engaging with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You literally can work that list of 10,000 people for 10 years before you hit them so much that they all say, shut up and leave me alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: More than likely what will happen is you overlap that 3% of their need with your service.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a good 10,000 list, you don't need more than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, just mathematics, logic and math.
[SPEAKER_00]: and calculation turns it from, I don't need a million people, besides, think of it this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many people do you actually need to buy your service at whatever price it is, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say it's 100, and all you do is move the zeros.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna show you how to make a million dollars, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: One client buys a million dollars worth of product or service, done, million bucks a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ten clients buy $100,000 worth of services, million dollars a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thousand people buy $1,000 worth of service, million dollars a year, once, one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thousand people, which are, that's less than 100 people a month, buy $1,000 product, one time a year, you make a million dollars, one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, if you go, oh, well, 10,000 people buy something for 100 bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100,000 people buy something for 10 bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: A million people buy something for a dollar.
[SPEAKER_00]: You make a million dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just move the zeros.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the point I'm trying to make.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody sells something for more than 10 bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, cool, so let's just say it's 100.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your goal is to get 90 people to buy it every month.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you make $100,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: The average income is less than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like $60,000, $50,000, $60,000 a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're talking about 90 people to buy something from you for $100 once a year for you to make $100,000, which is only three people a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which goes back to, if you talk to 100 people, if you connect with 100 people a day, and three of them go, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the next day you talk to 100 different people, three of them go, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they only buy $100 worth of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether that's eight bucks a month for the rest of the year, or $100, or $50 down, and five bucks for the rest of the year, it's 100 bucks, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's your $100,000.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go to Christelle Yes, Christelle
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, my son is telling me to sit down.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, great Now I get to sit down He says sit down mommy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so yeah, I was just gonna say the the google Uh page profile so good.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been needing to do that for I don't know seven years now So maybe now, you know, we'll both get it done um, not maybe we will other thing I just wanted to share I
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to be nice to myself, but I just upgraded my Beehive and I'm trying not to be mad at myself for not doing this sooner because I had four ads waiting for me in there ready to go.
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought I'd have to wait to be able to monetize with ads, but I guess because I had an account previously on Beehive, a paid account, and I've grown my list on there, I went in today and I had four ads already.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow, yes, I'm excited about that and I want to share also Justin you'll be proud of me I did my zoom video today so I can do this content system.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, I did a zoom video about Monetizing with beehive.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm learning from both of you and applying this content system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So good awesome Congrats By the way, I'm I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: I pivoted the CEO of your life newsletter to the brand blueprint builders newsletter.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I saw that and I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm pivoting Andy unfiltered newsletter, which is still going to be called Andy unfiltered, but it's going to be my personal newsletter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Andy unfiltered is going to be connected to my personal blog.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the brand blueprint builders is going to be connected to the brand blueprint niche down that I've been doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ironically,
[SPEAKER_00]: As you guys probably already know and I've already said the niche down isn't really a niche down It's just a niche down to focus, but I still teach the same stuff You need to be a little bit more likable a little bit more communicative a little better in your mindset and Then your personal brand all of a sudden takes off Yeah, I like the Andy unfiltered
[SPEAKER_02]: your personal brand because, yeah, you even did the content side-by-side comparison and the impressions and the traction and engagement and the likes were more on the Andy Unfiltered stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just roll with that and just make that your personal brand, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you're doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to have three domains.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to have my personal name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to have brand blueprint engine.
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm going to have 40x50.com, well, and 11th Street Consulting with my consulting company, but that, it doesn't have a blog.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other three are going to have blogs and everything is going to be focused on talking about how to, right, so, okay, let me, I'll give you, here's the whole playbook, ready?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's recorded, here's how it's going to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every piece of content I'm going to do is going to be about,
[SPEAKER_00]: how to build your personal brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the way, when you start, if you think you need to build a personal brand, the first thing you need is an audit of your personal brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So click here, put in your email, we'll send you an audit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You wanna join my newsletter?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool, guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Bonus, you get an audit.

[SPEAKER_00]: So you send the audit.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the bottom of the email or the top, wherever it is, in there it says,
[SPEAKER_00]: Click here to fix it and probably if you want to add more content, you need to probably get a seed file of ideas of stuff to talk about.

[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of that it says, by the way, if you want us to take your ideas and turn them actually into content, here's the upsell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, by the way, if you want us to just do the upsell and post and publish, here's the upsell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and by the way, if you want for us to just, you know, you just don't have time, here's the big package.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the way that the funnel's gonna work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I'm reaching out to
[SPEAKER_00]: The executives that I'm reaching to and the corporate folks and the CEOs, it goes the opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a personal brand and here's the giant list of reasons why.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to do it, great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our big package.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you're not willing to go there yet?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the package we do stuff where we publish it for you.

[SPEAKER_00]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's how we produce the content, personalized for you, customized for your audience, and talking about your zone of power.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll send it to you in an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you don't want to do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: How about if we just send you an audit every month and we'll send you 30 ideas for you to talk about?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only $97.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes up one way and down the other way.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the whole package.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my goal is to get 20 clients paying the top price.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go, let's go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad that's recorded.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it, Andy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's solid, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's solid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look, you only need like two or three executives on the 5k a month plan, then you're making 15k a month.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, or, you know, one time, yeah, 15k a month.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would even just say like, cause there's some people that aren't going to want to commit to like a six month endeavor and that's totally fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you offer them, okay, well look, this is my 90 day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything starts, everything starts with a 90 day, a 90 day guarantee.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to do 90 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing happens before 90 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I don't take on any clients for paid ads.
[SPEAKER_02]: if they want shorter than like four months now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it was three months, but now I'm like, no, I'm not going to spend that much time, energy, money, resources, fill in the blank for only three months engagements.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'm only doing four now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I'm only doing four months, like four months minimum.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, well, what's going to happen is it's going to go three months because 90 days is when you start to see differences in your profile changes, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Results and what I call the gut check, which is does your content align with your audience?
[SPEAKER_00]: But what's going to happen is it's going to start with
[SPEAKER_00]: For the first five, okay, here, here's the hermosi vision of that, by the way, that's the end story of everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, prices will change in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: But right now, if you want to be one of the first five people, I'll give you 80% off the $5,000 a month program.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for 997, less than $1,000, if you allow me to do your
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's your audit to begin with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's your audit afterwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every single month, we can show progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's your content and engagement before and after.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you allow me to do those things and use you as a testimonial and you'll give me a testimonial, including a video testimonial, I'll give you 80% off for the first five people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and as a bonus, if you do that and lock it in, that's your price for life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Solid I'm glad this is recorded because that that's your exact bitch right there Andy and that's locked in and Yeah, I love it And that's and that's what I and that's what I proposed To the company that I worked with and I still haven't heard back from yet, but I'll call them tomorrow but the proposal is Normally, it's $5,000 each for
[SPEAKER_00]: the brand, the company brand, and each of the founders.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because I'm really starting this new program, so that would normally be $15,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's what you get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for you guys, here's what we're gonna do.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you'll give me a testimonial and you'll do this for 90 days, I will give it to you for $1,000 for all three of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my first thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's only 300 bucks each.
[SPEAKER_00]: One for the company.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a steal for the X community here.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's an absolute steal.
[SPEAKER_02]: So don't sleep on that number, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, that's what I just proposed to one of the, okay, so I'm not, my target audience is founders, owners, and executives of companies that are worth a million or more.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my target audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I talk to them, I go,
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's your socials, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the first thing is, if you increase your socials, and you have a transparent leadership, transparent
[SPEAKER_00]: personal brand, your company valuation gets higher trust, higher customer valuation, higher customer trust, more retention from your customers, and as a result, more sales and your company valuation goes up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody wants more sales and their company valuation to go up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is my pitch to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the cost is, this cost over here, it's an indirect benefit, but it has long, long truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's got huge amount of retention, long tail, you know, SEO.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a foundational kind of step.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cheaper than most insurance that you have to pay for business, et cetera, et cetera, on and on and on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then when they go, OK, cool, what do we get?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I go, boom, here's your assessment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the assessment I did for the first company was 21 out of 100.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, even me, I only get 80 to 90% out of 100.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you guys only have 21.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can turn that into 50% in just a few days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then within a month, you can go from 21, double or triple that to that 30, 40, 50, 60% kind of engagement where you have multiple channels and you're producing content consistently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now your reach has expanded or tripled or quadrupled.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because right now, if your reach is only one little tiny narrow area, cool, that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it targeted?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it exact?
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, so that's the whole point.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the, that's my whole offer.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no gatekeeping.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And eventually what will happen is I will have more people than slots to use my system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will have to tell people, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, I can't afford any more personal time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Secondly, I don't have any more time to take on any more customers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the way, I'm pretty sure you can count 20 times fives, 100,000 a month in billables, and that would produce a $1.2 million company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since the entire thing is automated and not Andy-centric, it has a, you know, that's a 100,000 MRR on recurring cost and contract.
[SPEAKER_00]: That turns it into a $3 to $5 million valuation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's my current goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: My current goal is to, and just to be stupid,
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to make a $3 million company so I can, because I want to go talk to Alex Ramosi and say, look, I've got this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I produced this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got this much details and here's the plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so therefore, you know, I want you to invest in my company and show me how to turn this into a $100 million company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the way, you can take the majority of everything in profits.
[SPEAKER_00]: My goal is to build something, get out of debt, stop managing projects like I'm doing now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it, there you go, that's my whole big goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, in addition to that, the secondary benefit is, since I'm talking about personal branding, I'm gonna create a podcast and start talking to people, the Brand Blueprint Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna bring on these executives and have them talk about their personal brand and their struggles and all this stuff, which will, of course, increase their personal brand, benefit the details, and I get to be friends with, or at least engaged with, all of these people at the level I wanna talk to.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my whole plan.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, that's very clear.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's very clear, Andy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're here for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, do you want to go over to fantasy?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go to fantasy football games, podcast, fantasy pod one 34.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's going on guys?
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, first time in your, in your all space.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, um,
[SPEAKER_04]: instead of ask you anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're in the expert in the business world.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was having difficulty.
[SPEAKER_04]: We started our, our free dating app.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the world's only dating app for never married people, because the statistics of 25% of 40 year olds have never been married.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I've been doing the dating app for a while.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this reached out and doing a new podcast with fantasy football and have the halftime commercial was really cool with the dating app commercial in the halftime show.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Fantasy Football is a comedy show and it's free to listen to.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you got a few listeners on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the question is, how do we reach the 25% of the 40-year-olds that never married?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's about 100 million folks.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's hard to do that with zero-budget advertising.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm not verified on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got our t-shirts, the findmeonnevermarydating.com t-shirts, and the nevermarydating.com t-shirts and hoodies.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's kind of helpful when people have trouble talking, you know, reaching out, like grocery stores or shopping.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, how do you tell somebody you're single?
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, do you have any thoughts on that, with not much of a budget for marketing, any way to reach people to use a dating, a free dating app?
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead, Justin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a whole bunch of ideas about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the way, on Fantasy Football, I'm getting my butt kicked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got so many injured players, it's disgusting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, my entire bench is injured.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, okay, let's go to Christel and Justin, talk about dating apps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so the first thing I'll say is, just like
[SPEAKER_02]: you do any type of marketing to reach any other people on a shoestring budget is you got to ask yourself, do you want to do, uh, organic or paid?
[SPEAKER_02]: And since you don't have a budget, then you're going to, you're stuck with organic, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So organic marketing, what does that look like?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you're already doing X, you know, I would encourage you to do Tik TOK.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be a slow growth, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can fast track it with some.
[SPEAKER_02]: key strategies and tactics, like for example, influencer marketing, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So you find somebody who already has a large following with your demographic, with your ICP, your ideal client profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, you do some content collaborations with them perhaps on, you know, your social media platform of choice, which for your market, I'd say, you know, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, I think are really good platforms.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, X is another good one.
[SPEAKER_02]: But really, you just got to systematically put out massive amounts of content.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not just talking about one piece of content a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm talking about 10, 20, 100 pieces of content a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what it's going to take.
[SPEAKER_00]: And driving all of the traffic to an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: so that you can put them on a list and make them an offer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the Christel method, and that's the method.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the bottom line is go where, so it's like fishing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go where the fish are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't fish in the dry lake in the middle of the desert.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fish where the fish are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wherever the guys are that you wanna connect with, find them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Frankly, I think if it was me, I would probably go after ladies first.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can get a bunch of lovely ladies on your site, the men will come where the ladies are.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get a whole bunch of men on a men's site and there's three ladies, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I... That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so far I have about 400 members.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're free.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have one paying customer.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's about 20 bucks a month.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's my revenue is about 20 bucks a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so, okay, here's what I recommend everybody go to the bookstore, go to Amazon right now and find Alex Hermozi, H-O-R-M-O-Z-I and look up the first book is called 100 Million Dollar Leads.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find that book.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the way, you can get it for free or you can listen to it for free on Spotify or on his podcast or other places, but go buy the book, go download the audio, listen to it, listen to it over and over again until you start getting the right kind of leads.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, and essentially, let me break it down to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to find the right target audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you need to talk to or reach out to a hundred of them a day for a hundred days in a row and then cycle that until you have enough customers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a guy who comes on these shows from Nigeria
[SPEAKER_00]: And his first day, he talked to 50 people and got one customer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the next day, he talked to 25 more people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is like the third day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's talked to another 25.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's up to 75 people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, yeah, but that's not really 100 a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's better than zero.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And fantasy, I'll just another point to make.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I would see about if you can raise some money or get some small budget for marketing and you know, you can target Facebook ads very easily at, you know, single, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, cause people update their marital status.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's like singles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know and, but I commend you for getting to where you've gotten and I don't know how long you've spent, you know, at it, but, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I mean, and here's the catch though, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So even if you spent, let's say you spent 10 grand on ads to promote on Facebook ads, that $10,000, that may not turn into $10,000 return on investment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, that would be ideal.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you could break even, you're winning.
[SPEAKER_02]: to acquire users, but it's very challenging to turn that $10,000 into, uh, you know, actual pain users.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there's a progression.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just want to, you know, set expectations because I've seen people spend a hundred grand on Google ads and get zero.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they weren't my client.
[SPEAKER_02]: These were before they, before they worked with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just want to, you know, preface that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah, if you all want to check out the free app, I just was able to put it on the Samsung Galaxy store and getting some people on off the Samsung store.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you go to Samsung store and type in dating app, it's like like the first dating app that comes up and it's a free app.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I get a little bit of traffic from that, but it's like only one person.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're lucky if you get one person a month and you got no budget.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like I got no budget.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you got a nice website, nice app.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, hey, nobody knows about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So.
[SPEAKER_04]: I, nobody's going to post on it on X.
[SPEAKER_04]: So now I don't get any reposts or retweets or nothing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm like, yeah, I got 400 members and I send them a newsletter about once a month for about 400 people on there signed up.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like, if I send them a newsletter out, they'll like, I get some more traffic to the website, but that's pretty much it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it sounds like you need to spend money on a budget, which I don't have funds.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was hoping to be, y'all could maybe recommend it to some friends or families, or just check it out with your thoughts of the website, maybe the app.
[SPEAKER_04]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a free app.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best way to do it is post as much as you can on Instagram, TikTok, Shorts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the way, here's the most effective method to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go to Instagram and you create the video.
[SPEAKER_00]: You create the video, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You use the captions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put in the content in the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you send that,
[SPEAKER_00]: When you publish it, it goes to Facebook and Threads.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then take the video from that and put it right on TikTok.
[SPEAKER_00]: Copy the exact same text to the TikTok text, paste, post it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then take the exact same video, put it on YouTube Shorts, and then take the same text in the background, post it, but it's only 100 characters, so you have to cut it shorter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then take the result of one of them, TikTok or Instagram, and put it on X.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then just repeat that cycle 10 times a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't have to do it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I'll give you a couple of tools that will help you.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, Buffer.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you create the video and put it into Buffer, it will publish it to Instagram, TikTok,
[SPEAKER_00]: and threads for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know about YouTube Shorts, but it'll publish it to those channels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second, once you do one video, use AI to figure out what the video should say or do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just turn on your phone and do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first hundred are going to suck, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just accept it and do it anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you if you accept it, and you do it anyway, what will happen is you will get traction.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's almost no way to put 100 videos on Instagram and get zero engagement.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put one video on Instagram, maybe nobody sees it, you put 100 of them on in 10 days, people are going to see it, Instagram is going to go, Oh, look, they're posting a bunch of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see if people like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's the work you can do for free.
[SPEAKER_00]: You already have a phone, either a Galaxy or an iPhone or whatever you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put your Android phone, turn it on, record, boom, upload, send.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's and and you just got some you just got some money because I clicked on your ad fantasy So you just got some money.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: You come on to space you make money That's what we're all about here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So but yeah, I like I like what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a good niche, man It's a good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's I guess it gets encouraged.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of uh, kind of a letdown You do all the work on x and post and newsletters and all that and nobody goes to your site.
[SPEAKER_04]: I even uh
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's just any idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just, it's a zero revenue right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, don't have any money to invest.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's why I asked you all for help.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was all out of advice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was using it a while, but I had to get my account and sign back in and try to use it again.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now I'm just on X and I have trouble with Facebook.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can't get on Facebook for some reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram and then turn the Instagram videos into TikTok videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you have to do is copy and paste them into TikTok.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then put them on YouTube shorts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the way, all free, all the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to use a domain to do it, you know, go to Pork Bun, pay 12 bucks, get a domain for a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to Google and pay $8.50 a month for Google Business Workspace, and you get Gmail and Sheets and blah, blah, blah, and all the other stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do that, and now you can create an entire ecosystem on the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can use Blogger for free.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the way, this is the stack that I'm using.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blogger for free.
[SPEAKER_00]: $8.40 a month for Google Business, $11 a year, so $1 a month for your domain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Set it all up and just take your phone, publish stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: My daughter does it.
[SPEAKER_00]: She does wedding content.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people hire her to take her phone and take videos of little video clips of her wedding and then put it together into Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she only advertises on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: She only publishes stuff on Instagram and she has a website.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when people say, what do you want to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: She goes, click here and schedule an appointment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's a survey and that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is her whole funnel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Free Instagram.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll be using Instagram from now on.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll go use that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I wanted to see if you all think that was a pretty neat idea about the t-shirts.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you have to find me on nevermarryday.com and nevermarryday.com.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's on Amazon.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I got Zazzle store, so.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was hoping to get some shirt sales over port holidays.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause you know, a lot of single people are single during the holidays.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, you know, I just read a post on TNX.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, they were talking about how did I meet Singapore in person?
[SPEAKER_04]: They're afraid to talk to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I got this shirt and, you know, it says, find me on assist.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to go shopping and people can see, Hey, this person's single.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if they don't talk to them, but I see their shirt, I said, I got to check that deal upside out.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're on there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to check them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just.
[SPEAKER_00]: do that kind of stuff and then you're you're good to go but the secret is ten a day for like a long long time and the traffic will come it doesn't come the first day go ahead Justin yeah yeah no I mean I think just the last point I'll make here that I gotta run but the content
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I've been posting just for some context here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and I don't know how long you've been doing this fantasy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like you've been doing it a while and you've been putting in the reps, which is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, but I think the, the, you want to make sure you increase the frequency and the quantity of the content that you're putting out on social media on Tik TOK and Instagram and X.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that will bring, you know, more traffic and then increase the frequency of your newsletter as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So instead of doing once a month, maybe do twice a month, something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you can keep pushing the offer to sign up, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, Hey, we have this.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, bonus.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you sign up this month, here's what we're offering during the holidays, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can drive some revenue that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, but if you look at that pin post right here, for example, on my content that I did for October for LinkedIn, for example, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like.
[SPEAKER_02]: How did I achieve that growth?
[SPEAKER_02]: That hockey stick growth is just, I just increased the frequency and the quantity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I, I used to only post once a day, but then I started posting like three times a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so then I'm going to try to do 10 times a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'm going to try to do 20 times a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'm going to build an automation that's going to get to a hundred times a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's, that's what I'm aiming for, but I've been posting on X every day for two years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, no, I think you're doing some good stuff here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just stick with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a long game here, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a long game, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a long game.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just do what you can for other means of income while you build this side hustle here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, just don't stop.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the thing, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like just don't stop.
[SPEAKER_02]: I stopped for 15 years and I'm kicking myself still to this day for stopping.
[SPEAKER_02]: I shouldn't have stopped.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anybody get an opinion on our video of the t-shirt video?
[SPEAKER_04]: If y'all got some time to look at that, maybe you could repost or just look, give me your thoughts on the video.
[SPEAKER_04]: I used help to use AI to make that video.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a pretty cool video.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get your thoughts on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a 58 second video.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, post it in the purple pill.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll take a look at it.
