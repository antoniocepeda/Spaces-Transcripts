[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, hello, Joe Dell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today we're going to talk about, it's Wednesday, the 29th of October, my favorite day that ends in Y.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to talk about if you have no personal brand, are you going to be broke?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I kind of feel like it's the same way with AI.
[SPEAKER_02]: AI isn't going to take your job.
[SPEAKER_02]: Personal brand isn't going to destroy you.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what's going to happen is somebody who has a personal brand is going to go past you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love to hear it, Jodell, especially if you have any thoughts around this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you've got a book coming out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got all kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are doing all these amazing stuff with all your companies and all of your different properties.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love to hear your thought about personal branding.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here's the other thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you encourage all of your people and the people you have as employees, do you encourage them to create a personal brand?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that was for me, Andy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I missed that as I came up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, nice to see you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're my favorite person to listen to while I'm doing my work at the office here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aw, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, first of all, for personal branding, I think it's so incredibly crucial to finding yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know people always try to find themselves and all that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't really until I put pen to paper and started putting myself out there that I could really
[SPEAKER_00]: I really understood who I was more clearly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, having a personal brand really brought me so much clarity on myself, what I like, what I don't like, what I would stand for, what I don't stand for, especially in the world of AI and what I'm willing to put out there with AI and what I'm not willing to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know that I just wrote a book and I made sure that that book did not have one single iota of AI touch it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm pretty proud of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, for the people in my life, I definitely am starting to tell them like, you just need to have a personal brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what's your personal brand?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do an elevator pitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm always telling them to do an elevator pitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like succinct and clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, definitely love this topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited to hear more and dig in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I, you know, I believe, so I firmly believe you need a personal brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, well, I actually believe you have a personal brand no matter what.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the question is, are you going to take control of that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or are you just going to let everybody say whatever they want about you?
[SPEAKER_02]: And the moment you realize that you have a personal brand no matter what, and by personal brand, I mean digital presence, some persona digitally, where if somebody Googles you or does an X search or perplexity or whatever, and they find something about you, are they finding what you want them to find?
[SPEAKER_02]: And does it say about you what you want them to know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, because all of it's true, including all the bad stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's face it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're, we're all idiots.
[SPEAKER_02]: We all do stupid things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people don't like us.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just the truth.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that doesn't have to be the dominant information that shows up when somebody Googles your name.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can just be one part of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know of any person at all anyone
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyone who doesn't have detractors who doesn't have somebody who says yeah, I met that person I met that guy and yeah, he's not all that like okay fine But is that the first result that shows up or is that number 10 or number 100?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my whole point And for your employees, I think it's critical to
[SPEAKER_02]: I started this entire journey because in 2008, we had a big financial problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there were a ton of my colleagues who were having problems finding work.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, like, everybody I knew was struggling to find jobs, to find clients, to find anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the whole economy just kind of cratered.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I thought, well, what can I do to help?
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't, because I've worked all over the world, I've worked
[SPEAKER_02]: literally in four different continents.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've run hundreds of projects.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I have, I have, quote unquote, friends, people, acquaintances, work colleagues, all over the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I thought, how am I going to help them?
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't, you know, we can't have coffee.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, show up on Saturday.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll all have coffee and talk about what we can do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's kind of hard when
[SPEAKER_02]: Half of them live in a different country and the other half live, you know, hundreds or thousands of miles away.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I put together this website and said, here's how I'm doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's what's going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's what I think you can do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's some, this guy said this, this girl said this, this person said this, this website said this, and just kind of curated all of this information.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the same time, I was helping, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: A bunch of church leaders ended up asking me for help.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, they're saying this thing about the church, they're saying this thing about whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do I fix that?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just started advising them along the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't occur to me at the time that that's what personal branding really was, that it's reputation management and all of this stuff, but it really is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if you focus on curating, and what I mean by curating, that word is the same idea that
[SPEAKER_02]: that if you run a museum and you choose what pictures to show in the museum, you're the curator of the museum.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's the same way with your personal brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: With your personal brand, you are the curator.
[SPEAKER_02]: What pictures are you gonna show?
[SPEAKER_02]: All of them are still true.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just some of them are in the back, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them, you know, that's not my best look.
[SPEAKER_02]: That picture makes me look like, you know, I weigh an extra 50 pounds and I,
[SPEAKER_02]: I look like a giant goof.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not so sure I want that picture out front.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's find another picture to put the best image.
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, that's what Instagram typically is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Instagram is, hey, look at the best possible version of me, not the whole version.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do the same thing with your personal brand, but one of the things you should seriously consider is,
[SPEAKER_02]: What is the purpose, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I talked about it earlier today.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can use this technique to create an image, pretty much any image you really want.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can actively pursue creating it.
[SPEAKER_02]: This used to be what public relations teams did, what brand managers did, what, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: reputation management, all of those things are around the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is, if they search you, what do they find?
[SPEAKER_02]: When they write about you, what do they say?
[SPEAKER_02]: Today, you can take control of that yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not difficult to explain.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's easy to explain.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more difficult to execute.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I explain everything up front.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can take everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can try to do it yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have been executing on this strategy for 30 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So from an execution perspective, I can run projects as good as anybody else in the world, probably better than most, and I can execute on this strategy as good or better than everybody else in the world because I didn't just start yesterday.
[SPEAKER_02]: I started in the 90s.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK?
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's the strategy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You choose what your voice is, how you come across, what style of language, what level of reading level that you talk at, what vocabulary description that you use.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the way you do that is you choose your target audience, and then you choose the grade level of
[SPEAKER_02]: language that you want to speak at and then you focus all of your effort at those two things.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the what you're going to do and who you're going to talk to.
[SPEAKER_02]: What you talk about is the things that you have experienced and undeniable proof that you've done.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have managed hundreds of projects, $4 billion worth of evaluations.
[SPEAKER_02]: 300 million people are clicking and touching the websites and applications that I've personally had hand in delivering.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's undeniable.
[SPEAKER_02]: How that applies to each one of us is, along the way I've learned a few things about
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you coordinate?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you tell the organization about that?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you get people interested?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you share that information with them?
[SPEAKER_02]: How does it make a difference to them?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you get things to work as opposed to the way you think they work?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do they actually work?
[SPEAKER_02]: I can teach you all of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've applied all of those things to creating personal brands.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every one of my projects has had a name.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every one of the projects has had some kind of moniker, descriptor, definition, which I call the purpose.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I've turned that purpose into the question that I ask the team to turn the team into a team of people to become effective.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is, who do we serve and what problem are we solving?
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're gonna hear that a lot from me if you ask me any questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who do you serve, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Audience.
[SPEAKER_02]: What problem do you solve?
[SPEAKER_02]: Your superpower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the voice you use to communicate that is your voice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are the three pillars of effective communication.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they are always the same and they always work and they will never, ever, ever change because one thing is the constant.
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing you're communicating to are people.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're talking to the computers, you have to change the way you talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you're talking to people, people listen and understand and absorb things the exact same way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it doesn't matter their age.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't matter where they grew up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't matter what country they're in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Only the language matters.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you can overcome the language difference between French or Tagalog or
[SPEAKER_02]: German or Romanian or French or whatever You can communicate with people because those same foundational truths are foundational truths and So if you don't have a personal brand bringing it back If you don't have one in today's world Somebody who does if there's a competition between you and them they're gonna get a
[SPEAKER_02]: the nod.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to get more points.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to get more story points.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to get more reputation management points.
[SPEAKER_02]: However people score, do I want to work with Jodell or Netta?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I want to work with Elisha or Louisa?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I want to work with Jay or Jim?
[SPEAKER_02]: In reality, what happens is if you're doing a job,
[SPEAKER_02]: They look at the candidates, then they search the internet, and if they find a whole bunch of interesting stuff that one person did, and a whole bunch of emptiness on the other side, they go with the people who they can find and trust and prove and validate.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're selling a book, same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're selling a course, same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're selling an idea, same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if you're trying to get a job, same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so my personal opinion is the number one asset that you can build today more than anything else besides your finances and getting your finances in order, the number one digital asset you can build is a personal brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here's exactly how you do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's exactly how you do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You choose your voice, pick a target audience, pick your superpowers that you have done, have proof on,
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you only talk about those things for the next 30 to 60 to 90 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then afterwards, you evaluate if it's making a difference or not, and then you add on any new different stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the best way to do it is a blog.
[SPEAKER_02]: In your name.
[SPEAKER_02]: AndyWergodall.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: Blog.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the best way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then all the other things go onto it are just extra.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the algorithm rewards two things.
[SPEAKER_02]: It rewards consistency of posting, and the second thing is consistency of message.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because then it says, oh, Andy talks about this one thing all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Andy talks about the same thing over and over again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Andy posts consistently every single day, done.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we need anything about that topic, we're gonna put Andy in one of the results.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, there you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the whole entire thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I see we have a bunch of people who've joined us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have any questions, if you wanna talk about it, if you're concerned, if it's gonna leave you broke, if you're concerned that you're gonna get passed, grab the mic, raise your hand, and let's have a conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I see Katie and Netta have joined.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll get them here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll ask them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to, I'm just going to invite a bunch of people to come up and speak.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have some questions, please ask away.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that I have, I kind of feel bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Louisa is our lovely friend from New Zealand.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she
[SPEAKER_02]: Finally got the courage to finally ask a question, but she asked it in the last five minutes, like three times in a row.
[SPEAKER_02]: And finally, I just said, look, come up now and ask your question right away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, well, hello, Katie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for taking the mic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for raising your hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you this wonderful evening?
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, my lovely friend, Andy, I hope you're doing well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yay, Ned is here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, very excited.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a big fan.
[SPEAKER_04]: So at the risk of sounding a little silly, even though there's no such thing as a silly question, what does your space title mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Will no personal brand leave you broke?
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you help explain it?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have one, you'll make money.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you don't have one, people who do will take the money that you were going to earn.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's about claiming ownership over one's personal brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And how it directly impacts your bottom line dollars.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: so that nobody else, it's almost like copywriting a song so that nobody else can steal it and make money off of it when the money actually belongs to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I thought personal brand is to do with one's personal identity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's your question?
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just, I probably sound so silly, but I'm just a bit confused because nobody can steal one's personal brand if the personal brand is
[SPEAKER_04]: about oneself, they can steal ideas or try and copycat and imitate.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm a bit confused.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you have, if you have nothing, and they have something, if you're in competition between you and them, and they have something and you have nothing, they will ultimately win.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I get it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I understand.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not trying to get your personal brand.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's that if there were two competing brands, and yet the other person had set up their personal brand and was actually doing something, versus the other side who was doing nothing, then they're obviously going to win.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, well, most of the time, yes, that's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: The point is, when you solicit an investor, or you solicit a partner, or you solicit a company to be a brand partner with you, or you try to get a job doing anything, or you're trying to submit a proposal for someone to work with you,
[SPEAKER_02]: and they go, ah, that sounds really good, but I don't really know anything about you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I get a reference?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, when I get a reference, is a Google search with a whole bunch of information that aligns with what you're talking about, is that just as good as a reference?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, references are better.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you don't have a reference and you don't have anything on Google or anything on Perplexity or anything on any of the search engines, can't find anything about you on anything,
[SPEAKER_02]: your chances of them approving or getting or hiring you or becoming a partner or going into business with you become less and less and less and less and less.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's so simple to fix that you should fix it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Without it, you risk the fact that they're gonna say, no, thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Katie.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do have to make myself laugh and hopefully this will make you laugh as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because when you were just given the example, I was like, immediately wanted to say, because you were like, oh, when you meet with investors, and when you meet them, I'm like, give them the NDA.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_04]: That will really show you who's ready and willing to invest or work with you on your projects.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know that most big investors that have big, like the sovereign funds and other things, they won't sign any NDAs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason they won't sign any NDA is their perspective is, why am I gonna sign an NDA with you?
[SPEAKER_02]: I probably already have that idea from somebody else.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I sign that from you, I'm already violating what I've talked to other people about.
[SPEAKER_02]: And since I don't sign NDAs, what do you think, I'm gonna steal the idea?
[SPEAKER_02]: Non-disclosure is when you're competing with equally minded people.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're dealing with investors, they're different minded.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a different perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't want your idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't want your execution.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't want to replicate your business.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want to give you money and get more back.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's their business.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I was just pulling from personal experience, not with investors, but when I had a meeting with one of the UK's biggest broadcasters in television, and I put together this pilot series of how we would implement what it is that I've built and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_04]: But nothing would stop them building their own mini versions of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I did, I
[SPEAKER_04]: not paywalled it, but I said, okay, well, I will send all of this over to you, but you at least have to agree that you are, this is strictly private and confidential, um, and trademarked and copywritten.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, and if you don't want to open it, good luck.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're still in trouble.
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway, it wasn't, um, necessarily from an investor standpoint.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that meeting wasn't, um,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, me seeking, it was what you were just saying on the same level right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were having a meeting about it and I said yes, I'd be more than happy to
[SPEAKER_04]: show you underneath my skirt, which sounds ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_02]: Over the kimono, show them everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: I will open the dressing gown.
[SPEAKER_04]: However, you know, as much as I'm willing to be open, honest and vulnerable and share with you something very precious that I have built, I would also like the safety and security knowing that you're not going to just go off and try and run with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not because I'm precious about what I've built, but because no one can do it as good as me.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would hate for anybody to try and implement something that would devalue the credibility about what I've, you know, the system I've built.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: It totally does.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know what I've found?
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's what I've found.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can take my idea and you can try to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: What you'll find is that I've solved all of the individual problems that you're going to run into.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've already solved all those and so you can take my idea and I can tell you exactly how to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead, go try.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can't, you just can't be me and you can't answer the questions that I've already solved.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can just take my idea and start from zero where I've been doing this for 30 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, but I was about to send them like top-secret private information and I think that when anyone's building any of that sort then you have the right to attack yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you can always just have a conversation and you know what there are people out there they're gonna steal your idea no matter what you do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean let's be honest if somebody really really is interested and you have really really such a great idea and it's really really probably all that stuff right and
[SPEAKER_02]: they may steal it anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: Regardless of whether you have legal counsel or not, whether you have legal protections in place, and when it comes push to shove and you take them to court, they're just gonna go, oh!
[SPEAKER_02]: My bad, but since we already made a billion dollars, here's your pittance, whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: Someone stole my face once, actually multiple times.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's many catfishes of me, even on dating websites, which is just so bizarre.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know why they do it, but yeah, it's weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go to Jodell.
[SPEAKER_02]: She had her hand up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jodell, if you wanted to jump in, then we'll go to Netta, then back to Katie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, cool, yeah, no, I just, it's so funny that you guys brought this up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my book, Run It Like You Own It, I was all excited, got it on Amazon, and when I went to go put it up, somebody else from X has a book on there, it totally looks like it's all been done by AI, but called Run It Like You Own It, but I had copyrighted that title.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think because I've built a personal brand, I've been like sharing it all online everywhere, you know, that's kind of protected me from having to like compete with this person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, of course, you know, I reported them and all that fun stuff and send them my copyright info, but still it was, you know, they do say, what is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Imitation is the best form of flattery.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought, oh, that must've been a good book name if they're copying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So an interesting,
[SPEAKER_00]: An interesting thing, but I think having that personal brand definitely will insulate me from, you know, them scooping sales or what have you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you know, I grew up in the West, in the United States, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cowboys and Indians.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously, Colorado, Cowboys and Indians.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we used to have this saying, and the saying goes like this, only the trailblazers get shot.
[SPEAKER_02]: and they only get shot in the back.
[SPEAKER_04]: So... Well, that's why you got to sit with your back towards the wall and not the door.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what the mafias say.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, well, but the point is, think about in the covered wagon days, you're in a covered wagon, you're sitting up on top of the wagon, there's nothing behind you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And where do people attack?
[SPEAKER_02]: They attack from behind so they can sneak up behind you and then shoot you in the back with the arrows.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, unless you've been shot in the back,
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you even really a trailblazer?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of my whole that was the whole kind of idea was You know if you're out front They can only see the backside of you, and that's all they have as a target to shoot at so if you're getting shot in the back You're out front Anyway, let's go to neta All right, thanks for having me so um the thing I wanted to say is I
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw yesterday that approximately 14,000 employees from Amazon got laid off.
[SPEAKER_03]: And hi, Katie, thank you for the heart, got laid off.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're having a live stream.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Andy, thank you for appearing on our live stream again, on Feathered live stream on Sunday.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what I wanted to say is, like those 14,000 employees, those that did not have a personal brand,
[SPEAKER_03]: They're starting off their job search on a wrong foot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if you already have a personal brand, whether it be for your business, that's a business brand, but personal brand, whatever the case may be, you already have a leg up.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's not only having a good brand, it's also making sure that it's done right.
[SPEAKER_03]: got the right information, it represents you well, and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_03]: So having the brand isn't enough, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's also making sure that it's maintained, it's nurtured, and it gets love on a regular basis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, that is exactly true.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are one of the unfortunate people who had given your time and money to a company like Amazon, and then Amazon, and by the way, Meta did, Google did.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you go to the WarnTracker, W-A-R-N, WarnTracker, Google that.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the United States, if you have more than 100 employees and you're going to do a layoff, you have to notify the world 30 days in advance.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you can go in there right now and see how many people have been laid off.
[SPEAKER_02]: I posted it the other day.
[SPEAKER_02]: 60,000 people just in California have been laid off this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if they didn't have a personal brand, those are 60,000 people that are trying to find some other form of work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some are going to go to get a different job.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some are going to create their own thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some are just going to suffer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you don't have a personal brand, you're behind the eight ball.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's very simple to create.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've described it a bunch of times.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll do it every day going forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll tell you exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not gatekeeping any information.
[SPEAKER_02]: The the only thing that here here's here to pull back the kimono and tell you here's the thing The personal brand benefits the people at the top and the bottom of the socioeconomic scale the most if you are an executive and you run a company and you your company doesn't and you don't have a personal brand if you increase your personal brand and you become transparent and visible and
[SPEAKER_02]: your company valuation goes up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's lots of studies that prove this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's my that is my target audience.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the people who have nothing and they nobody knows anything about them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're trying to get a job or they're trying to get their first jobs or whatever, creating content and creating a presence of them digitally will give them a leg up and getting into those roles.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you are at the top and you don't have a personal brand, your company is suffering 10 to 40%.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you are at the bottom and you don't have a personal brand, you may never get a job or you may not get a job for this immediate future because of the current economic situations.
[SPEAKER_02]: So everyone needs one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are varying levels of efficiency along the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: But companies, if you want a shocking statistic, go to your favorite LLM and look this up and say, if companies have a good leadership, if their leadership has a good personal brand, how much does their company valuation increase?
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are studies by Gartner and McKinsey and Forbes and New York Times and on and on and on, Harvard Business Review, on and on and on and on and on.
[SPEAKER_02]: about personal brand having a direct correlation to bottom line valuations and customer, you know, not retention, but customer belief in your product, customer trust in your products and services.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything goes up if leadership has a good personal brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything goes up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's what I personally target.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I talk to you guys about all this stuff so that everybody knows that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I use it for content to create and build more information.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gives me lots of reps, gives me lots of ways to talk to people.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an interesting topic that I love.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just gives me content that I can immediately go and transfer directly to those people who it benefits the most from.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Netta, how are you creating?
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you have a wonderful personal brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: And by the way, Netta, I don't know if I've ever actually said this, but the startup circle itself came from the hunt.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Netta facilitates a fantastic space to help people get jobs in technology, she and Sean Charles.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the people we all met by going and participating in the hunt, me and Timo and Justin and Kevin, we all met from our overlap of engagement with the hunt.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the hunt is the reason why the Startup Circle exists.
[SPEAKER_02]: The hunt is the reason why this community exists, why I'm doing the things I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to give you credit for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And credit to Sean.
[SPEAKER_03]: He started it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sean Charles.
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate your kind words.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he should keep going because he has the same kind of brand that you do because of the consistency and the dependability of that community.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know that there's a lot of people who are here today who are listening that met us on the hunt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Without question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I could have this conversation with you later, but I'm with a lot of guilt.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm reducing the hours for this space to two hours because I am overwhelmed with unfeathered and we are overwhelmed with unfeathered and there's more to come.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I could talk to you about that in the messages.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I have a feeling it will affect the brand, at least when I host.
[SPEAKER_03]: People are used to having me host for 5 to 8 to 10 and a half hours at a time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this was pre-unfeathered.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, it's the recipe for a burnout because I lose almost half a day when I go, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I have two spaces back to back.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I host so I could talk to you about that later.
[SPEAKER_03]: But um with a lot of guilt That is gonna be reduced to two hours and we'll see what happens But yeah, I could talk to you about that later.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't wanna face.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's totally totally fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I Don't think you should have any guilt that and the reason here's why I
[SPEAKER_02]: When you establish a personal brand, I could host a three or four hour space and I would get three times or four times as many people joining.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the point is you choose your brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: You choose what you want to be known for.
[SPEAKER_02]: And most of the time, being more signal, less noise, more
[SPEAKER_02]: more impact in a shorter period of time, gives you even more kind of clap and credibility than it does to just be on there for eight or 10 or 12 hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, that's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: But also, okay, I mean, you get, you know, you get these waves of people who join, listen and leave.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's and that's fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: But
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be just as effective to say we're only doing it for these two hours That's it if you don't get in and if you don't ask your question right away You know put it in the purple pill or send me a DM or send me an email.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll get an answer to you later, but We're only here for this period of time that exclusivity that
[SPEAKER_02]: condensed timeline with boundaries produces a very specific effect in human beings.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why we had tests due on Friday, or papers due on a certain day, or you must start at a certain time, and you have to stay until the bell rings.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't just leave when you're done.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are all things that
[SPEAKER_02]: are amplification of normal human behavior.
[SPEAKER_02]: So limiting your activities and then telling everyone about it, hey, we're going to do the same thing, but it's only going to be for two hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you miss it, sorry, you'll have to like come next week.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it should give you even bigger numbers and even more impact in a shorter period of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think there's any negative at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think the advice you gave is really great for people like myself who run communities, but they're branded communities, but their brand is also to create content.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you don't have to show up all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'll continue the conversation in the DMs, because I have a lot more things to say, and I think other people want to talk.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's keep going.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, well, I don't have any other hands.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you would like to speak, I know Elisha grabbed the mic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Elisha.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you have you How are you doing on your talking to 100 people a day?
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you got a client the first day.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's give us a status update on what's going on with you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you able to talk?
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, um, since the first day, I've not gotten any yet.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got, I got two people to respond to me and both of them were, they were just, they just responded.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were not interested.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fine.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And today I'm at number 75.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have 25 more to go.
[SPEAKER_06]: So let me, let me ask a question.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, you, you talked about how you drive traffic through your blog posts.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you are a consultant.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's easy.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's easier for you to just to drive traffic through there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a designer, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: And most of the times I don't see myself as a,
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't see myself as, what's the English?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll think about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll think about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, okay, so let me answer your question directly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I drive traffic to the blog post so that the blog post gets the most amount of information from
[SPEAKER_02]: Google, but I don't, except for mentioning it, and if you look at my, just look at my posts.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't say, click here to see, there's no click bait.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no click here to get more information, maybe once a week.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not every day, not every post.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't believe in the click bait.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe in the, if I provide you good content today, and something of value, you're gonna wanna read what I put out later today or tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I put out something of value every day, you're going to come back offering more and more and more.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I can keep putting out value, you'll just become a loyal fan.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my philosophy.
[SPEAKER_02]: My philosophy isn't click here and then go get more and then click here so I can get three clicks out of you instead of one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not my purpose.
[SPEAKER_02]: My purpose is so that the algorithm
[SPEAKER_02]: will serve me whenever anybody asks any kind of question that's in the kind of general area that I'm providing services in.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: My goal is not for you to find me, always me, nobody but me.
[SPEAKER_02]: My goal is for you to find me to prove I am who I say I am.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I don't offer things in this space.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, every, like once a month, I'll say, hey, I'm having a webinar at the end of the month, come join it and we'll teach you how to do this thing, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But other than that, there's no offers on social media.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's hardly any offers on the web page, on the blog.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just proof.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I say, hey, I've been doing this for 16 years, 17 years, whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, I've done thousands of posts, and I've got millions of page views.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty easy for you to go check, click on a website, and go, oh, 2.6 million page views since 2008, or whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then it just proves I am who I am, and it proves what I say is true.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the main reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that takes time to get to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead, Elisha.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, OK. You say you don't.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll try to put out click here, click here.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if I may ask, how do you, what's your sales funnel like?
[SPEAKER_06]: What's the process?
[SPEAKER_02]: What is my sales formula?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: My sales funnel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's what the sales funnel is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I DM people and say, I've looked up your socials and it seems like you're doing good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you like to do better?
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's an audit of all your socials.
[SPEAKER_02]: Click here to get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if they put in their email.
[SPEAKER_02]: then my little system will run and do an audit of their social media profiles and the alignment of them to their audience and then send them a result.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the end of the email says something like,
[SPEAKER_02]: If you'd like to fix this or you'd like, you know information that comes every single month Click here and join my community for I think it was $47.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's you know, November 1st It's gonna be $97 a month and then by the way, if you want us to curate and produce content for you It's there's more money and if you want consulting and a full-on glow up and you know fix everything for you and your company It's you know, like ten times that That that's my funnel
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's a loop.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would implement it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll try it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, sorry, there was a little delay there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't mean to talk over you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lead magnet in exchange for your email, so you can put you on my email list.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the lead magnet is, here's an assessment of your current social media.
[SPEAKER_02]: An audit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the audit shows that there are areas you can improve.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I say,
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you like a list of improvements?
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you like me to help you with the improvements?
[SPEAKER_02]: And they choose.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The idea, I mean, if you read Gary Vaynerchuk, or Russell Brunson, or the launch formula by Jeff, what's his name?
[SPEAKER_02]: Jeff something, or Alex Hermosi, it goes like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give things a value, so much so that they think your paid stuff is worth it.
[SPEAKER_02]: When they ask you, give them something of value in exchange for their email address.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the emails and the DMs, make your offers.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how they say it, so I'm not smart enough to do it to figure it out on my own.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just doing what they said.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a really good student.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Netta.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, I was away for a few minutes and I know, I think it was Elisha who was asking a question about being a designer.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what his question was, but when I think of personal brand, when I think of designer and entrepreneurship, I think of Chris Do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, please look him up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will put his name in the comments And he has a lot of valuable Quality content.
[SPEAKER_03]: He does live streams on linkedin as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Follow him there and the other company that he leads called the future I've met him in person as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've went to his workshops
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just, I can't find the future account, but all I will say- It's F-U-T, no U, F-T-R-E. Yeah, yeah, that's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's top notch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even with the free stuff he shares, you get so much value.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just wanted to share that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Chris, is it Chris Do?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you say his name?
[SPEAKER_02]: Chris Do?
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's what I thought, but I've heard somebody announce him as Chris Do anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think he corrected him either, so that's probably- Oh, fun fact, he even came to the hunt because Sean kept tagging him and messaging him.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was in the hunt once, actually, 2023, fun fact.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and I was fangirling over it, so anyhow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank God no one can find that recording.
[SPEAKER_03]: Embarrassing moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, sorry, sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, okay, so let's What, okay, what other questions do we have?
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got 15 minutes left.
[SPEAKER_02]: What other questions do we have?
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, I'll continue to tell you my story, which is fine, but
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd rather answer your questions or at least talk to you about what you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Netta put her hand up first.
[SPEAKER_02]: So ladies first and then Luisa.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, it motivated Luisa.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go to Luisa and then I'll go after.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, Luisa.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good morning, Andy and everyone.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sort of not really got a question, but it might lead on to a question.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've been working on my personal brand.
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't had one really.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've just been putting myself out into the shop and, you know, the last few weeks I've been working very hard to finish the website because I've managed to get us onto a local info map.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we show up on a map that goes into hotels and
[SPEAKER_05]: information centres and places like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when tourists and travellers come to Taranaki, they look at this map and they can see the different places around the mountain that they can visit.
[SPEAKER_05]: So because I've come to realise that, you know, just relying on the traffic that comes through the door is one thing, word of mouth is great, but it's also giving them the ability to come back and shop when they're not actually there.
[SPEAKER_05]: and our stock changes quite drastically.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I can see this being quite a massive ordeal.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't know
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how much, so for everyone, Louisa has a, it's like a souvenir shop near a tourist location or a vacation location.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that a good way to put it?
[SPEAKER_02]: I probably screwed that up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a souvenir shop, but it's also half a co-op.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I have over 42 creators, mainly in the North Island around Taranaki.
[SPEAKER_05]: that actually have items in the shop that I sell on behalf, on commission.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so by organic content is like creating, um, it's like advertising.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the, what, but you need to do more of it because advertising, you can target your audience specifically.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you, uh, if you do just organic content, in other words, just posting stuff,
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyone will find it and people will find it who?
[SPEAKER_05]: Want to find it eventually so make sense Yeah, so you mean like on my Facebook page posting us really yeah, I Don't I still haven't set up any other Like ticked off or anything like that yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do have Instagram Well Instagram gets
[SPEAKER_02]: more kind, this kind of traffic, more people use Instagram for this kind of thing than for other things.
[SPEAKER_02]: They use so typically, and this is so this isn't really true 100% of the time, but most of the time, people use Facebook to connect and find out what other of their friends are doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they use Instagram just to scroll through and see interesting things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you'll probably have more people interested in following the stuff you're doing if you use Instagram than Facebook.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I sort of find I don't get a lot of feedback from Facebook.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've also found that just advertising in the local rags isn't really giving me any extra traffic, even though I would like to support those businesses, because everyone's struggling during these days.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just trying to analyze, I suppose, what actually is giving me return for my dollar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the good news is that Instagram is free, and X is free.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you don't have to spend money to post on X or TikTok or Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can literally post as much as you want until the platform says, yeah, that's too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there are even ways to do that as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, yeah, I like that idea.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's interesting because it's learning how to do it a new way.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have all the old traditional newspapers still wanting you to advertise there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know it's not working.
[SPEAKER_05]: And just having to say to them, no, sorry, I'm doing something else.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you mean that when they call you and ask you to advertise,
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, when they pop into the shop.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know them personally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the way I look at it is like fishing.
[SPEAKER_02]: If, and I used this example yesterday,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you get your boat and you get all your fishing gear and you get your bait and you get your lines and get your fishing poles and you get everything set up and you go park in a dry lake bed and you throw your cast your bait out into the dry lake you're not going to catch any fish because there's no fish there right but if you go somewhere where there's a lot of fish you have a better chance of catching a fish where there's fish
[SPEAKER_02]: not on a dry lake in the desert.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's such a dumb example but
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the way the village feels like during wintertime, a bit of like a dry lake.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we are very fortunate the locals support us and come and get their presents and things.
[SPEAKER_05]: And everyone says to me that they love the shop, but I find it hard to get people to do feedback.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, go to my website, give me some feedback, go to my Facebook page, you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: It really doesn't seem to happen, ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, remember, you have the, you know, between the 1 and 3% rule, which is only 1 to 3% of people are interested in the thing you're selling right now anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you might have to talk to 100 people to get 2 or 3 people to go, oh, interesting, where I want to see that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which means 97 of the other 100 are gonna go, yeah, no, no thank you, screw you, get away from me, why are you, you're a crazy person.
[SPEAKER_02]: And every other excuse they can give you to keep you away from them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the bottom line is, you just have to keep going.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you ask enough people, you will make sales, you will get customers, things will happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not advice.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just the truth.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll give you an example.
[SPEAKER_02]: For my consulting company, I send out outbound at least 20 to 50 a day of
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you looking for this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you need some help?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_02]: Blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_02]: 20 to 50 a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of that, I get maybe 20.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to get 75 to 100 responses a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I'm getting 20, 25 responses a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I get 25 responses a day, which means then they go through a sequence of replies.
[SPEAKER_02]: hey, thanks, this is what we do, this is what we're looking for, can you tell us about it, here's the criteria that we're looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if they go, oh, sorry, we don't match that, then there's a sequence of emails that respond to that to say, thanks a lot, appreciate it, and then a couple days later, hey, keep us in mind, we do this kind of thing, okay?
[SPEAKER_02]: If they say, yeah, it's kind of interesting, then we follow a different path and we just keep, so the point is, each year,
[SPEAKER_02]: I send out between 30,000 and 50,000 emails over the whole year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I reply and respond to 25,000 to 30,000 emails a year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of that, I end up with two, three contracts a year.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the kind of numbers that I deal with.
[SPEAKER_02]: 50,000 outbound emails.
[SPEAKER_02]: 20,000 qualification emails turns into two or three contracts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, my contracts are bigger, but still, that's the kind of numbers that I do every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not 1% or 2%.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like 0.01%.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK. Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's good to know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just means I have to work harder.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just have to do more.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't necessarily have to work harder.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just have to focus on getting more out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really is a volume game.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I could do 500,000 a year, I would get 20 to 30 contracts and my firm would be 10 times as big.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just bottom line, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's about the size and width that I'm able to manage and consistently produce, so that's what I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, if I could do...
[SPEAKER_05]: Very inspiring.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I could do 500,000, I would, and that would produce 10 times the volume.
[SPEAKER_02]: The point I'm trying to encourage you is,
[SPEAKER_02]: If you ask 10 people and no one says yes, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ask 1,000 people and get three people to say yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool, then you got three customers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then ask another 1,000 people and maybe nobody says yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you just build a cadence and keep going.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the only way to stay in business in any business.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care what business it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when they talk about 3% of people are willing to buy, man, if 3% of the people are willing to buy my services and the amount of volume that I send out and who I compete with, yeah, I would have 10 to 100x the income, the revenue that my company creates.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, thinking about that.
[SPEAKER_05]: We actually, a lot of people that come into the shop actually buy things.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not always a lot, and it only takes one person to spend up and you know, you've got a good day.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I would do?
[SPEAKER_02]: I would, okay, here's an idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can take this or not, but this is what came to my immediate mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every time somebody came in to buy something, I would say, do you know, if you sign up for our email list, you get an automatic discount, 5%, 10%, 15%, whatever it is, okay?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you can send them an email every other week,
[SPEAKER_02]: for the entire year and say, we've got these really cool things that just came in.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't even have to come into the shop if you want one for Christmas, if you want one for a birthday, you want for, here, click here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the three things we're offering this week at a discount or whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then every time somebody comes in to buy something, it's like, you know, if you give us your email in exchange, that's value, we'll give you some money off.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a fantastic idea, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, how many people would be like if I just give you my email I get 15% off Okay, how hard is that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Take their email and send them a thank you so much for you know, be awesome Yeah, thank you so much for coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: We really appreciate you being in the shop blah blah blah blah.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is so great Whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, we're gonna send you special stuff that only the people on the email list do and by the way If you know anybody go ahead and forward them to this email anyway
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, if you do that, what will happen is you will double your customer base because right now you're only relying on walk-in traffic and advertising on the roads or the signs or the shop.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you start to create an email list, now you'll create even more customers, including people that'll buy stuff for Christmas that just didn't get a chance to come by the shop yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, and also a lot of our customers are overseas customers that come every year.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it'd be nice to get them on the list and then they can see what's in the shop.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, they might pre-order or put it on the list and definitely come and visit.
[SPEAKER_02]: My wife and I, we went to Kauai Island in Hawaii for our honeymoon.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we love that place.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I typically find something from some shop in Kauai and I order it and have it delivered so I can give it to her for a Christmas present because she loves it so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just telling you stuff that I already do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So other people will do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's good to know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Great TV.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, I see Will has joined.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got one minute left.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead, Will.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll have to keep this short, but yeah, I just come back from food.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really, really love the topic because this is basically everything, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I caught a little bit of what you were saying while I was eating, Andy, about how it's the top percent and the bottom percents.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a fluctuating thing, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone who's at the bottom now may be on the top later.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it behooves everybody to have a personal brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like we talked about earlier, that's just a reputation that people can see online.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's make it happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think in this day and age, I can't think of one person who wouldn't benefit from at least having a digital presence.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Love the conversation, what I heard of it while I was eating and what I've managed to catch live up here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to put a bow on the entire thing as I close up, and hoops, we'll get to you tomorrow, and Rose and Dreamer, thank you, Stephen, thank you for grabbing the mic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now is the best time in history, actually the best time in history to create a personal brand was about five to 10 years ago, okay?
[SPEAKER_02]: The second best time is today.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the worst time is waiting till someday in the future because every single day it becomes more and more difficult.
[SPEAKER_02]: Technology is going to establish more and more of what it thinks you are.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you are going to have to, it's going to take more and more and more effort in the future to create a curated personal brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my recommendation is start now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the way that you start is you establish your voice, you establish your target audience, and you establish your superpower, the things that you've done, your zone of genius,
[SPEAKER_02]: your core competencies, the things that you've done over and over again that you can prove that you can do.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you do those three things, you have the foundation to build a personal brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, here's the thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why, Andy, why do you do this?
[SPEAKER_02]: I do this for one reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's my one reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now, today, at this moment in time, there is somebody on their hands and knees praying to God, begging, sobbing, that they have a problem that they need help answering.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you guys listening, you are the answer to their prayers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you don't create an offer, if you don't build a brand, if you don't make the offer to somebody, to them,
[SPEAKER_02]: Eventually they'll find it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you don't make the offer, their problem will go unsolved and they will continuously just cry into the dark, dark night.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the metaphor that I use for you to create your own business, for you to establish your own service, for you to step up and make a difference in the world is like lighting a torch and carrying it out into the dark world.
[SPEAKER_02]: because the world is cold and dark and the torch is light and warm.
[SPEAKER_02]: So grab your torch, light it, carry it out into the dark world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, I'll see you guys tomorrow, bye.
