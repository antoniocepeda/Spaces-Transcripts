[SPEAKER_04]: All right, let's get going.
[SPEAKER_04]: Today is November 3rd, 11-3.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a Monday, and we're talking about systematic ways to create, huh, systematic ways to create or build a brand.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have somebody here who, let's do this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, what's going on, Jordan?
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love the the the bio disabled comedian podcast guest fan of America's first bare-knuckle boxing gym Yeah, look at what I look at the video.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just posted on things my pin tweet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh Yeah, okay, I not sure I can see it yet It's the opening of the gym.
[SPEAKER_05]: So let me see if I can send it to you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I can see it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just that if I if I run it, I don't know if what can you guys hear me?
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I'm watching a video.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I can watch it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, that's a cool looking place.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're uh Where what what part of the country is it in?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh in Dallas?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep, Dallas, Texas.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice Bare-knuckle boxing gym.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of crazy I'm sure yeah, and I found out that I was the first guy to ever do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I've heard that's better than opening up a boxing gym and being one of like 50 Well, it's definitely something new and interesting Where okay, I see the weight room you've walked through the lobby and the weight room.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where's the actual?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, there we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this is this your boxing area in the back?
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah, where you've got some heavy bags and Okay, you know it's kind of like a speakeasy boxing gym.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got the whole thing kind of hidden from the public
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's going to open up in a couple of days.
[SPEAKER_04]: So fantastic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Congratulations.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you already have some signups and people engaged?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of like my next thing is, uh, I ordered a business cards today and, uh, I'm kind of trying to figure out what I want to do in terms of like online marketing and that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is one of those where I would definitely like get an email list more than like my community career.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think listening to a lot of your tips and stuff would be helpful.
[SPEAKER_04]: I firmly believe in email listening and here's why.
[SPEAKER_04]: I said it earlier if you were listening with the Sales and Marketing Mastery one we do in the morning with Justin.
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody said, well email is dead or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's my answer to that.
[SPEAKER_04]: If the world is digital, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're in Dallas and I'm in Sacramento, it's pretty hard for us to have coffee, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty hard for us to sit down and have lunch.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a four-hour flight from here to Dallas, or whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's four hours, might be more, but it's like half a day in the airplane going, what, 400 miles an hour?
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so here's the problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you send somebody a DM and they want whatever you've got,
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you give it to them?
[SPEAKER_04]: And the second problem is if you have a site that you log into, usually people say put in a username and then a password.
[SPEAKER_04]: I call those credentials, a credential pair, username, password.
[SPEAKER_04]: But most of the time they just use their email for their username.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody remembers their own email and you only have to then remember
[SPEAKER_04]: what the password is, not your email plus your username plus your password.
[SPEAKER_04]: So most people just use their email.
[SPEAKER_04]: So email, still super critical because that's how we deliver stuff to people.
[SPEAKER_04]: And number two, that's how we use to log into everything, including your bank, your gym, everything, okay?
[SPEAKER_04]: Email's not dead.
[SPEAKER_04]: I personally believe email is not gonna be dead.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's gonna be longer and longer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Think of it this way.
[SPEAKER_04]: When we all had, depending on how old you are, if you're old and like me, every home eventually got a telephone number and that number was shared with everybody in the house.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when you moved out, you had to get your own phone number in your apartment.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we all got cell phones.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, hardly anybody has a home family number.
[SPEAKER_04]: Each person just has their own individual cell phones.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when the kids are all, whatever, junior high, high school age, there's no more home phone.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's just the, you know, three, four, five, however many people in your family, they all have cell phones.
[SPEAKER_04]: And those are the numbers that everybody connects with.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so email,
[SPEAKER_04]: and your phone number are the two most important things you have to prove your identity on just about everything else on literally everything else so your phone is a two-factor authenticator by itself it's with you and it is a number that somebody can call if not it's the number
[SPEAKER_04]: Provider systems, called the phone providers, whether it's T-Mobile or Verizon or Orange or wherever you are in the world, they're only connecting to you via your EIU main number and your phone number.
[SPEAKER_04]: So your phone number and your email are as important as your ID and your driver's license.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when somebody passes away,
[SPEAKER_04]: Do not turn off their phone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep their phone and unlock it as soon as possible and keep their phone as long as you can, at least for a year, to find everything that's gonna cycle through and then send them either a text or an email to their phone on all the stuff that's broken, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: I validate that tip, that's a good tip.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, the point is, get email.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, if right now, think, okay,
[SPEAKER_04]: There are a lot, go to your favorite LLM.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care which one it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can go to the Chinese ones, it'll still give you this answer.
[SPEAKER_04]: And ask it this question.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I had an email list, how big an email list do I need so that I could sell things to the email list and not have to have a job ever again?
[SPEAKER_04]: And they'll tell you a number, it'll tell you a number.
[SPEAKER_04]: Between 10,000 and 30,000 people on your email list,
[SPEAKER_04]: and you can sell, you can do a launch every month and half to 1% are gonna buy whatever you sell if they're an engaged, warm email list.
[SPEAKER_04]: They actually read your emails.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's worth, okay, so a 30,000 email list and you sell a $500 product at a half a percent engagement.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's 600 people times.
[SPEAKER_04]: 500 is $30,000 a month.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can sell a $1,000 product and get a $200 commission from it, 20%.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not outrageous.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can make a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, oh yeah, email's not dead.
[SPEAKER_04]: Email is growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: because of all of the things i just mentioned it's it's never going away uh... or if it does it'll be replaced by some other thing uh... i see josh is on a josh and then the uh... johnson is a johnson johnson who gosh or the war for me or what for me anyway hopefully got that close
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Ben.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's going on, Mav?
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, I see Mav down there, and Golden, and Antonio, and Butterfly, and a whole bunch of folks.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's going on, Ben?
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you today, this wonderful Monday in November?
[SPEAKER_04]: Happy November.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, happy November.
[SPEAKER_03]: Doing great, sir.
[SPEAKER_03]: How was your Halloween?
[SPEAKER_04]: Good.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't really do much for Halloween at our house, but yeah, it's always good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're talking about building a method, excuse me, a systemic method to build a brand.
[SPEAKER_03]: Personally, I don't have a method to build a brand.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, I would definitely love some tips and advice aside from,
[SPEAKER_03]: I know your biggest tenement is building out an email list, and that's something I definitely need to follow through on.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's one.
[SPEAKER_04]: The biggest tenement for a personal brand is a blog in your name that you consistently post on, targeted towards your target audience, and talking about the things in your superpower.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you do those three things, define your voice, choose your audience, and pick your superpowers, and we'll talk about that in a second, and then the systemic part is,
[SPEAKER_04]: you create a blog post and post it five days a week.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is what I did on my blog 40x50.com, two million page views, all organic, no page, no promotions, just organic page views in 18 months.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: So are you using AI to help turn that out or is it all by hand?
[SPEAKER_04]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, OK. Well, so here's the thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to pick a audience.
[SPEAKER_04]: And my suggestion is to pick an audience of about 10,000 individuals.
[SPEAKER_04]: 10,000 people that match your criteria for your audience.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then you pick how you want to be, how you want to sound.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you authentically speak?
[SPEAKER_04]: So that when I write and I speak, sounds the same.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you see me in person, you hear me talking, you read what I say, all sounds like the same voice.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really important for authenticity.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's what I call it's personalized to you because, Ben, you talk different than I do.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you're speaking, we know it's you and not me.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I'm speaking, we know it's me and not you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fair?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, sounds good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Second step is you gotta choose your audience.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I picked, and this is research from Alex Ramosi and Gary Vee's book, Datating Great Trading Intention, and Jeff Walker's book, The Launch Formula, and Jack Canfield's Success Principles, and on and on and on and on and on, all these books that I've consumed.
[SPEAKER_04]: 10,000, a niche,
[SPEAKER_04]: or niche, however you want to say it, of about 10,000 people.
[SPEAKER_04]: And here's the reason why you picked that number.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can send a note to about 100 people a day.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can reach out to 100 people a day and send them something.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of that, one or two or three of them maybe are going to respond.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then what do we do with them, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you heard, put them on your email list.
[SPEAKER_04]: Send them to a landing page, so they click a thing, get on the email list, and you send them whatever the thing you promised is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Trade, something cool for something of value, okay?
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, you can do that for 100 days in a row.
[SPEAKER_04]: 100 times 100, 10,000.
[SPEAKER_04]: You do that for 100 days in a row, and one, two, three people a day on average,
[SPEAKER_04]: join your email list so at the end of a hundred days you have between a hundred and three hundred people in your email list but those are the one percent of people who are very very interested in whatever the thing is you were talking about so they highly amplified maybe twenty percent of them by the thing you're selling so let's assume you're selling something for a hundred dollars you talk to a hundred people
[SPEAKER_04]: One, two, three of them say, I'm interested.
[SPEAKER_04]: You send them the thing, you follow up with another email that says, yeah, cool, and if you want this more, and it costs 100 bucks a month, click here, this is what you get.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever it is, okay?
[SPEAKER_04]: And each week, every time you do seven days of that, or let's just say 10 days of that, you get two people to pay.
[SPEAKER_04]: After 10 weeks, you have 20 clients paying 100 bucks a month.
[SPEAKER_04]: 100 bucks times it's $2,000.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?
[SPEAKER_04]: This is not rocket science.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you sell something for $500, and you have 20 people buy it, and you end up with $120,000 annual recurring revenue business, 10,000 a month, 20 times 500.
[SPEAKER_04]: So find something that people will buy for $500.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell 10,000 people about it over a 10 week period, or 100 days, and do it, and then when you're all done, if you didn't get 20 customers, you only got 10 customers, okay fine, that's 5,000 a month in revenue, you just do it again.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you do it again, and you end up with another whatever number of customers it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because of 100 people, 40, 50% of them are like, too busy.
[SPEAKER_04]: 20, 30% of them are like, cool, but I can't do it right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: 10% is like, maybe, yeah, I kinda need that.
[SPEAKER_04]: 5% is like, where was that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Where's the link again?
[SPEAKER_04]: Dang it, I missed that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And two or three people are gonna go, oh, okay, well I need that right now, click.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so if you have a qualified list of 10,000 ideal customers, and you sell something for $500 a month, you can turn that into $100,000 a year in revenue.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay?
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, if you're- Right, Ben?
[SPEAKER_04]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds solid, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Simple, but I imagine not easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: But with enough reps, you know, then,
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a numbers game, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's always a numbers game.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me explain exactly what I said this morning.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a consulting company that I have been an independent consultant for about 30 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's my entire plan.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ready?
[SPEAKER_04]: I send out between 50 and 100 emails a day, five days a week.
[SPEAKER_04]: So roughly 20,000 to 30,000 a year.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of that, I get about
[SPEAKER_04]: three or four callbacks a week.
[SPEAKER_04]: And of those three or four callbacks a week, I get two or three interviews where I can submit a proposal.
[SPEAKER_04]: And of that, one or two companies hire me and my firm once or twice a year.
Okay?
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I sell services at, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: hundred and twenty five hundred fifty dollars an hour so there's one thousand nine hundred and sixty billable hours in a year either provided or somebody else on my team provides the services and we end up billing them two hundred four hundred thousand dollars a year well and we usually sell two to three year contracts but it takes twenty to thirty thousand email outreaches a year
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me switch it for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I said, here's what you offer, here's what you say, send this to 100 people a day, and if you do that, between now and the end of the year, or between now and a year from now, you'll probably get a contract for 100 to $200,000 a year.
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you do what I just said?
[SPEAKER_04]: Most people say yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And my point is, I've been doing that for 30 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: I never described it like using the, okay, so Gary V's book, Day Trading Attention, taught me how to describe the activities I was doing to get attention.
[SPEAKER_04]: Alex Hermosi's book gave me the language and vocabulary to describe it in, how do I get the leads?
[SPEAKER_04]: How do I find the hundred people to send their stuff to?
[SPEAKER_04]: offers, how do I make the offers so that they go, Oh, I need that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get this other thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how the offers work.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the money models is now, well, I've only been selling one thing for one group of people for what, for 30 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I just sold two things, don't you think I would have increased my ability to sell more?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, of course.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um,
[SPEAKER_04]: And so all I did was take the things that I have been doing for years and years and years, and then just learned how to put the right vocabulary with them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now I'm talking to people about, because I do all the things that I'm saying, just, I've never just made it as blunt as I just did.
[SPEAKER_04]: 50 to a hundred emails a day.
[SPEAKER_04]: You get maybe one call a day.
[SPEAKER_04]: You get three or four calls a week.
[SPEAKER_04]: That turns into the ability to put in a proposal four times a year, and I have about a 20% close rate.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if I can put in four big proposals, probably going to win one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes I win two of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how it goes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: So switch that from a, because, okay, if you're selling
[SPEAKER_04]: $125 an hour services for 1,960 hours for a three-year contract, that's about a $600,000 contract, okay?
[SPEAKER_04]: If you sell 150, 175, or $200,000 a year, it's a million dollar contract, okay?
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you just take that down and say, I'm just gonna sell you this thing that helps benefit you, you can make the 10,000 a month, I just want you to pay me 500 a month to help with this thing,
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: That makes it easier to sell and understand.
[SPEAKER_04]: You only need 20 people to pay you 500 bucks a month to make 10 grand.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, here's the part where most people fail.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, this is the part where most people fail.
[SPEAKER_04]: They think they need to sell to people who are just as needy as they are.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's just not true, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Will is one of my, I consider Will a friend, and Will is a fantastic guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Will sells these amazing services to help people become better mentally, okay?
[SPEAKER_04]: All this, he's got a school, he's got this amazing programs, and he's a great guy, okay?
[SPEAKER_04]: But if he sells to people
[SPEAKER_04]: who only make $25,000 a year and he wants to sell a $25,000 a year program, $2,000 a month, he's gonna have a hard time.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if he sells it to people who make $200,000, $300,000, $400,000 a year or better, sells it to the company that makes $25 million a year and then gets an executive program where they hire Will to teach all the executives for $6,000 or $7,000 or $8,000, now all of a sudden Will has a whole different market to sell to.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll give you a practical example.
[SPEAKER_04]: My brother-in-law is a fantastic martial artist.
[SPEAKER_04]: Seventh degree black belt.
[SPEAKER_04]: Seventh degree black belt.
[SPEAKER_04]: Been teaching martial arts for 25, 30 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: He is literally one of the most amazing athletes I've ever met in my life.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay?
[SPEAKER_04]: Fantastic, amazing guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?
[SPEAKER_04]: He had a school in an average demographic socioeconomic part of town.
[SPEAKER_04]: Middle class neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_04]: Moved, opened a new school in one of the more elite neighborhoods in town.
[SPEAKER_04]: Same instructors, exact same program, exact same prices.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the new location, three times the income.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly the same instructors, exactly the same thing, different location, different demographic, different clientele, three times the money.
[SPEAKER_02]: I definitely need to change my clientele.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, but that's the whole point, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: The whole point of entrepreneurship is find things that people need and then help them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll give you one.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a crazy one, but I know this true because I've coached these folks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of my services is mentoring projects, PMOs, program managers, executives, and all of that change management.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do we change organizations, et cetera, all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: The most important or the most common characteristic of high-level executive leaders, the one thing that is the same across all of them, they are
[SPEAKER_04]: massively lonely and have no one to talk to.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they can't talk to their staff because they can't show weakness and, oh my god, I doubt this and I don't know what to do and I feel like I'm an idiot all the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Every single person, every single leader feels that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yet they have to put on
[SPEAKER_04]: the other hat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, everything's fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're all good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything's great, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: When was a politician, last time a politician said, no, you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: Look, we don't really know what's gonna happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's gonna be a bunch of garbage.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when we vote for this, we don't know if it's gonna actually crash the economy or not.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, they all say, this is the best thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if we don't do this, oh my God, the world's gonna end.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, they always take the positive forward.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're driving into the wilderness approach.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the truth is, every single executive that you know is massively lonely and desperate to find someone that they can trust confidentially.
[SPEAKER_04]: Desperate, not just, I'd really like to have someone to talk to, but desperate like, man, if I could have someone I could just talk to every night for like 30 minutes, it would change my life.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so, systematic way of building a brand.
[SPEAKER_04]: Number one, you have to define how you want to be heard, your voice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Number two, you have to pick an audience.
[SPEAKER_04]: We just, I just gave you a whole Andy's, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: TED Talk on how to pick an audience.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the third thing is, what things do you do well, do easily, that people ask you to help them with, that you don't even realize are that big a deal?
[SPEAKER_04]: The things that you think are easy, other people think are impossible, and that's what you need to help them with.
[SPEAKER_04]: The things easy for you and impossible for them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, put those three things together.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, take that, tell AI, can you make me
[SPEAKER_04]: Post on this can we talk and if you don't know how to do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I literally have a program for $97 I will take the information and send you 30 ideas that you can talk about for the entire every single month it refreshes every month it gives you brand new information And it can tell you all of that stuff every month new information and new things new ideas new phrases new talk and You know
[SPEAKER_04]: Hit me up if you're interested in that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not that big a deal, but that's something that can help you out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because most people go, cool, they start a blog, they start a podcast, and they go for seven episodes and they run out of energy, they run out of things to say, they run out of the next topic.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I can fix that for minimal cost.
[SPEAKER_04]: Will, what's happening?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's late.
[SPEAKER_04]: How you doing?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you at dinner?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you in the middle of something or what's going on?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually just doing a little bit of late night work here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my day's all wrapped up, I'm all fed and in my relaxation time, but I'm just opening up a new channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I appreciate the kind words as well about the school community.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm working pretty hard on that to make it the best in class for daily identity recalibration.
[SPEAKER_01]: But somebody told me earlier on that it's really hard to book time with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm making, I'm making a, I'm making some additional options available for those who don't use the school platform as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, make, if they search you, they should be able to find you and they should be able to find some way to book you, whether it's, I don't know, do you use anything like the buy me coffee or intro or anything like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: So as we speak, I'm actually setting up standstill or direct because that actually has integration with calendars and I've integrated zoom so people can just buy an hour of my time to go through a calibration call directly through there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that solves that problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I'm just trying to get that optimized and add to the link in bio.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm working on right now, but it's been a great day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm kind of bummed I had to run from Justin's call earlier because it sounded like you guys were getting into my favorite topic of identity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but I had a call to get to which I I could not postpone.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have had so many people that
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if people recognize them, but if you Googled them, you'd go, oh gosh, who have reached out to me saying, Andy, I've got this, I need to do this thing, I want to do this thing over here, I don't know who to talk to, I don't know how to get there, I don't, you know, and I'm like, well, let's talk about building a systematic approach on how you can accomplish those things, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: authors, founders, VCs, people in equity, people who've built companies and they're all, everyone, see, I kind of look at it this way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone who has succeeded in something, when they exit and they get the money and they put it in the bank account, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And by the way, this is, in my experience, what happens to people when they retire.
[SPEAKER_04]: They retire, and then the money comes in, and then their sense of purpose goes away.
[SPEAKER_04]: They do one of two things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Either they search for another sense of purpose.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that usually comes with, I want to be on a board, I want to write a book, I want to be a speaker, I want to do this, I want to start a course, I want to do some coaching, whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: They want to do something, or they start another business.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or they just decide, I'm going to play golf and I'm going to do the leisure thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that kind of satisfied them for a couple years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then either they come back to the, I want to get back in the game,
[SPEAKER_04]: or they go on the couch and watch TV and die.
[SPEAKER_04]: And having worked and provided services to government contracts for many, many, many years, I have many, many friends who I've worked with for many years, retire, do the golf thing, and then I go to their funeral.
[SPEAKER_04]: It sucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, Will.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I was going to jump in with one thing, but you've made me think of another thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I wanted to say, has anyone heard of kind of the story?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a bit of a tragic story.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a guy called Marcus Persson.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you probably know what he made, but you probably don't know who he is, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But he sold his company to Microsoft for $2.5 billion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for those of you who don't know, he's the guy that made Minecraft.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he bought the biggest house in Beverly Hills, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: He actually outbid, I think it was Rihanna or Beyonce or some singer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he got into a deep, deep depression because he was lonely and he couldn't relate to the people around him.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had everything he physically wanted except the one thing that actually matters, which is fulfillment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it always reminds me of that Tony Robbins quote, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Success without fulfillment is the ultimate failure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because he lost the thing he loved in pursuit of a thing that he thought he wanted.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that thing that he thought he wanted, it never is the thing you want.
[SPEAKER_04]: He already had it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He already had it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a, the thing, the really ironic thing, and this is something I try and help people see, you think you want the money, you think you want the car, you think you want the X, Y, Z, but it's a permission slip for you to feel a certain way and the feeling was available all along.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that reminded me of when I retired from banking, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Last year, when I first came onto X, so it was May last year,
[SPEAKER_01]: I lasted two days, Andy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to take it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to take a year off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my wife said, hey, take some time off.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just retired.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go for another year or two and then start something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, OK, I'm going to relax.
[SPEAKER_01]: I played some video games.
[SPEAKER_01]: I cleaned the house and I lasted two days and I was like, I need to build something.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hence, that's why I started my X journey.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't want to retire.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I totally understand.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was on a
[SPEAKER_04]: very challenging politically challenging but very financially gracious and blessing project where I made a lot of money but it was just hell for two and a half years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I came home
[SPEAKER_04]: And I said, okay, I don't wanna work overseas.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been working overseas for 10 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: I live in California, my family's here.
[SPEAKER_04]: My children were little.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I said to my wife, I don't wanna get on airplanes and fly all over the world anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I was working in Egypt and Romania and France and the Middle East and all over.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I said, I don't wanna do that anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I said, I just wanna be home.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I thought, okay, I'll be home and I'll just let things settle.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I dabbled in this and I dabbled in that and I dabbled over here and there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I said, ah, this is crazy, I gotta go back to work.
[SPEAKER_04]: I gotta go do some more things that have, in my opinion, have value.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, is it worth my time?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it worthy of me waking up, getting dressed and going somewhere?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's gotta be that kind of project.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's gotta be worthy of my time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I totally understand.
[SPEAKER_04]: And about four or five months in, I decided I gotta do this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then everybody looked at my resume and looked at my stuff and went, um, what's going to stop you from, you know, getting a phone call and getting on an airplane and leaving us again?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I said, I don't want to do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I, I couldn't get any more jobs.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had to start my own company and I had to start my own company and say, I'm here to provide services.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is what I'm going to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's why I've just, I've said, I've been a reluctant founder for all these years because
[SPEAKER_04]: I really wanted to go to work for someone and do something to help them out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And everybody was afraid that I was going to just pull the ripcord and bail on them again.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that turned into me having to start my own company.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they're like, Oh, well, we can hire you because we know if you, if we're hiring you and we're paying you to do stuff, you're going to do the stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: They could believe that, but they couldn't believe that I could be a full-time employee for them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I haven't really been able to do that for,
[SPEAKER_04]: decades.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now I don't want to.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to keep doing what I'm doing and selling other things.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the systematic part of it turned from how do I engage with getting people to hire me
[SPEAKER_04]: to as a full-time employee to how do I get people to hire me as a consultant?
[SPEAKER_04]: How do I get people to be interested in me as a consultant?
[SPEAKER_04]: How do I prove that my consulting is worth the money?
[SPEAKER_04]: How do I get more people to help me with my and it just grew into that and that's that's how that whole thing happened but it was because I took a year off
[SPEAKER_04]: It ended up being a year and a half.
[SPEAKER_04]: I took six months off and then I went, okay, let's go.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it took me another year after that to get people to go, oh, okay, fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been 18 months and you haven't gone on an airplane again?
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, we kind of believe you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was gonna say it sounds like that turned out to be a bit of a blessing in disguise, that you didn't get an employment contract, because now is far more high leverage to be a brand or be a consultant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now you have an independent authority outside of the employer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's probably a blessing in disguise that that happened.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was and, and ironically, in the I didn't, okay,
[SPEAKER_04]: I may sound like I'm smart, but I'm just a big dummy like everybody else, okay?
[SPEAKER_04]: Two years ago, I decided, okay, Elon bought X, I'm like, okay, I'm going to get back involved.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a following, I got a bunch of stuff, I deleted a bunch of people, I added them back, whatever, and I built, I bought
[SPEAKER_04]: how to build a digital course.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I wanna do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I bought a course on how to build a digital course, and I built a digital course.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I got a bunch of people to come to a webinar, and they bought it, and then I realized, oh, I failed at this because it's the wrong audience.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good idea, wrong audience.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then I went through the next cycle.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, well then maybe we need to do this other thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was like way too big.
[SPEAKER_04]: Way, way too big.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, he goes, can you tell me what happened when you got brought back, when they hired you guys to go back to this other place to do some work?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I said, well, I showed up and everybody wore a black shirt, because I had worn a black shirt for, I had worn a black shirt for a long, long, long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he goes, huh, so your brand is a black shirt?
[SPEAKER_04]: Coffee on a Sunday morning, he goes, oh yeah, so your brand's a black shirt?
[SPEAKER_04]: You always wear a black shirt.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I thought, wait, maybe, yeah, again, it's probably obvious to every one of you, but you know, when you look in the mirror, you just, you don't see the obvious.
[SPEAKER_04]: You see what you wanna see.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you mean I actually know how to help people build a brand?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I built a brand so I can do the same thing for them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can tell them what I did, what I didn't do, and how it worked and how it didn't work.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, guess what?
[SPEAKER_04]: Since August, branding.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can actually relate to that a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to confound that, seeing skills in yourself is much more difficult than seeing skills in somebody else with that objective viewpoint, because we're always in our own head, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're always looking at life through the lens of our own experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's very difficult to objectively view ourselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I very much relate to that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I look at it like, you know polarized glasses, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So your polarized glasses, they have a lens that has two different filters so that you can, so it will filter out some of the harshness of the lights into your eyes.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what polarization does, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And sometimes when you look at the world, you put on your own polarized glasses that you've focused yourself to see what you wanna see.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not what everybody else sees, but only the things that you are looking through your own rose-colored, polarized glasses.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you see the world your own way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every now and then, you need somebody to go, give me those glasses.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here, look now.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is what I see.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you see that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, yeah, but I don't really like that, because I don't really think about it that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but everybody else sees you that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: then all of a sudden the dawning starts.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it takes some while to come to fruition so you can, in your mind, go, oh, I really am that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really do that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really do provide that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's why the easiest one to point out is on your brand blueprint.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your voice, how do you want to be heard?
[SPEAKER_04]: Your audience, who you want to talk to?
[SPEAKER_04]: And your superpowers, what do you want to be known for?
[SPEAKER_04]: That last part, that's the hard part.
[SPEAKER_04]: The voice is easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: You talk to me, I'll capture it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll capture it in a way that I can reproduce your voice, that you think, how the hell did you do that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, cool, it's not that hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we work together on your audience for the services or the products you want to provide.
[SPEAKER_04]: that the superpower, we are all blind.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're all blind.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you're sitting, you're listening to this, you're listening to the recording, you're listening to this in the future, you're listening to this live right now, and you think, I don't know what my superpower is, join the club.
[SPEAKER_04]: None of us do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes it takes somebody else to go, yeah, let me tell you, you do this really good.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, you do this better than everyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, of course, because it's so easy for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: How is it easy, you know, if it's easy for you, how do you know it's not easy for everybody else?
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, yes, Will.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, that again, just I'm hearing conversations that I have daily.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's so relatable that other people have these exact same conversations.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I was going to say is, you talked about the rose tinted glasses and people seeing the world as they want to, but more often than not, I find they see the world as they're conditioned to see the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things I've been working on with my community, I'm not sure if you've seen the videos this month, is rewriting the life story.
[SPEAKER_01]: Going back to those old formational moments and actually choosing against.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, when you study the psychology and the biology behind this, it's really interesting, because the brain will take a snapshot when it first encounters something, and it will create a meaning of you and the event.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, I give the example in yesterday's video that the first time you, or it might have been today's actually, the first time you have a launch, right, as an entrepreneur, and it fails.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your brain records that and goes, oh, that's what happens when I make launches.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is all below the conscious awareness, because the nervous system is always tracking for threats.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the next time you go to make a launch, it's like, check the database.
[SPEAKER_01]: What happened last time?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's likely going to happen this time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the lens through which most people see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I had to say what my superpower was, and this has been pointed out to me,
[SPEAKER_01]: is that I've got a very good way of guiding people to change that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So go back, reframe it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this all comes from Neville Goddard.
[SPEAKER_01]: This isn't my stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is in the Bible.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, this is the idea that you see it the way you want to see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You train the nervous system and the brain to see it through that lens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now the next time you go there, the outside situation didn't change, but you changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think the example of like changing the glasses is a really apt one because that's what we do
[SPEAKER_01]: when we do a personal transformation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's really interesting that you brought up that metaphor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, well, that's, that's the way that I do it, because the, I, I've had the unique experience of operating from a leadership perspective, in so many different areas, and realizing, they're really not that different.
[SPEAKER_04]: The biggest difference between running a project here or creating an organizational transformation in United States or in Egypt is that they speak a different language in Egypt as their primary language.
[SPEAKER_04]: Human behaviors are really not that different.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are some
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some colloquial things culturally that happens in different areas of the world, but basic human need, desire, and responsiveness, it's pretty much the same.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're all humans.
[SPEAKER_04]: You cut us, we all bleed red.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know there's a couple unique weirdness of people who bleed green and gold, but you know what I mean.
[SPEAKER_04]: The point is that it's really fascinating that I'm in France,
[SPEAKER_04]: with French-speaking people, and they respond the same way.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm in Egypt, and they're Arabic-speaking, Egyptian Arabic, and they responded the same way.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm in Turkey, and they're speaking Turkish, and they respond the same way.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I thought, huh, maybe people respond the same way, not
[SPEAKER_04]: Not what we're kind of brought up to believe that this group responds one way and this group responds differently.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, there's some minor differences, but it doesn't matter if it's the people that I worked with from Japan or from South Africa or from Sweden or from wherever.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've worked with people literally from every part of the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're all just people.
[SPEAKER_04]: We speak different languages.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have some different cultural biases.
[SPEAKER_04]: We all get hungry.
[SPEAKER_04]: We all want food.
[SPEAKER_04]: We may want different food, but it's not really that different.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in order to move a group of people from where they are to something different takes a systematic approach of coordinated communication and activities.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that coordination and communication of activities is pretty much the same.
[SPEAKER_04]: The only difference is the language and sometimes the messaging.
[SPEAKER_04]: But really, the systematic way of doing things, if it's worked for other people, it probably worked for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my whole point today.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to learn how to get leads,
[SPEAKER_04]: Go read Alex Ramosi's book.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to learn how to get quote-unquote attention, go read Gary Vee's book, Day Trading Attention.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to learn how to launch consistent product launches, read Jeff Walker's book.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a whole library of books.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you've seen the things behind me, but I've got lots and lots of books I've read.
[SPEAKER_04]: Boil it down to the bottom line.
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a systematic way of building a brand.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that requires each one of us to do the same things.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to figure out what our voice is.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do we want to sound?
[SPEAKER_04]: Number two, we have to pick an audience.
[SPEAKER_04]: Number three, we have to talk about our superpowers.
[SPEAKER_04]: I see Alex is on here, I love Alex, she's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_04]: She talks about your competitive advantage.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, get that too, 100%.
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of mix those two things together because most people, until they figure out what their superpower is, they don't know that that's a competitive advantage.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't know that they can just go to Google and,
[SPEAKER_04]: and find the answers and other people can't.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some people can look at a system and realize exactly what step is broken.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some people can look at a clock or a car or an engine or an elevator and it's broken and they can go, huh, well did you check?
[SPEAKER_04]: And then whatever they say is like 80 or 90% one of the problems because they just have
[SPEAKER_04]: They just see things that way and each one of us has this unique, beautiful ability to see things.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just because you can see things the way you see them, not everybody sees them that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not everyone even looks at them that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: We all put on our own glasses and we all filter our own minds into what we think is right and what we think is good.
[SPEAKER_04]: And my part of it is
[SPEAKER_04]: It's okay to take your glasses off.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's also okay to ask people you trust to tell them, to have them tell you what is it about you that's super awesome and special.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's difficult for most people to hear, though.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because when they tell you this one thing that you think is so easy and not that big a deal, and like, why is this such a big, why is this anything special?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because to you, it's like eating.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't take any effort.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you don't realize that the things that you do that are super easy and special, that you can, the things you see, the problems that you can solve without effort, that is a special gift that you have alone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your combination of those things is special for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it takes other people to point them out sometimes because we all have a tendency to believe that, well, everyone can do it, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody can do math in their head.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone can calculate percentages instantly and be within a 5% or 2% response.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the answer is, nope.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are some people that can't do fractions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you teach them how to do fractions, they put it on a paper, and you give them the method, you give them the step-by-step things to go through, they still don't get it right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And other people just take fractions and switch it into percentages, multiply them, and then put them back into fractions and go, yeah, it's 7 16ths.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course it's 7 16ths, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a little bit less than 50%.
[SPEAKER_04]: And other people don't, they don't think that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you do,
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever it is that you do well, some people can listen to a conversation and realize which person's lying.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some people can look at the traffic and realize that guy is the problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, there's a hundred, I'm using all of these crazy things because I don't see a lot of hands.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the point is, we all have superpowers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we all need to describe what they are so that we can offer that as some kind of ability to help other people solve their problems that they have with that superpower.
[SPEAKER_04]: We all have problems.
[SPEAKER_04]: And collectively, we all have the answers.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we don't have them independently ourselves.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what else is going on, Will?
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got 11 minutes left in my little time window.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, I think let's make this practical for everyone who's listening, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because one of the things I'm really big on is let's take what we know and embody it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because as we've said many, many times on these spaces with Justin and everyone else, like knowledge is not power.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, it's just potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what do you see in me, Andy, that I can't see in myself?
[SPEAKER_04]: What do I see in you?
[SPEAKER_01]: We've known each other for a while now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been in all these spaces for about a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me do what you just said and ask the question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got no idea what you're going to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is like completely, I have no idea what Andy's about to say, but he gave me some really good advice with that story about changing my gym location.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me see what you got for me, Andy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it was changing your gym location and realizing that you were, you were selling to people on the first floor and you should be selling to people on the top floor.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have the ability to see things in people that they don't see themselves you can look through what they say and hear what they mean and You have the ability to understand that in context and the ability to communicate it back to them in a way that with the language that they're using meaning the level of
[SPEAKER_04]: Like if it's a what what level of education you have the ability to just scale that instantly you can go from A high level of educational discussion down to a very simple level of discussion without losing any fidelity or any meaning Well, thank you very much I will uh, I will reflect on how I can use that because that is something that
[SPEAKER_01]: again, I think does come quite easy to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just like people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just like talking to people.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yes, but most people build vocabulary in their mind.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they use that vocabulary to talk to people from then on.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you, you're not constrained by that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can you could we, we can sit here and instantly we can start talking about Kierkegaard
[SPEAKER_04]: and why that matters from a psychological perspective.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can talk about Descartes or Jean-Paul Sartre.
[SPEAKER_04]: We could go lots of places and we'd probably lose the audience.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the point is, you can just go there.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you can also go, Andy, let's get back down here to the basics.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I appreciate that and I recognize that in you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate the insight as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that, like, because I believe the very, very strongly that the best way to do the best way to show is to do right proof over promise, as we both know from Alex.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember last year, and I think I've told you the story, Andy, when we were on the school games weekly calls.
[SPEAKER_01]: He would bring up someone's about page and just absolutely roast it for being over promising x y and z and he just keeps saying proof over promise state the facts and tell the truth And that really stuck with me.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I do appreciate that as well I appreciate the honesty Well, that's what I see um and by the way if you uh
[SPEAKER_04]: If you all of you in the audience listening if you are like me and have a tendency to speak to talk to and communicate with your LLM of choice You need to enforce a number of boundaries or it will
[SPEAKER_04]: in a sycophant way, tell you how great you are.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's a great idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's do this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's a great, you know, if you're like, earlier today, I was talking to, not talking, but chatting with one of the LLMs.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I said, I need a outrageous vehicle.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm thinking about these things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's work through the ideas about which one should I choose as the
[SPEAKER_04]: If Andy wins the lottery or everyone in the world actually buys my products and services, and I get to the point where I'm financially able to just buy some outrageous car, what should it be?
[SPEAKER_04]: And we went through a number of discussions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, this one and this one and a couple of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't matter what it is, but these ideas.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I said, well, what about this other one?
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of like this other car.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, oh, that's great.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it just went right down the rabbit hole with that car.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, no, that was just, okay, if there are 10 choices and maybe this number 11, can I put that in the choice list?
[SPEAKER_04]: Instead, it took number 11, like, okay, that's the answer.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it went right down the story of, here's how you put stuff in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's how you do stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's how you build it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not what I wanted that I want I want the discussion to include more of those criteria because the way that I interrogate problems is what is the objective we're trying to achieve and then what is the the last step of that objective when we achieve it what's the last step that we do and then I
[SPEAKER_04]: back into every step necessary to get to the answer.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the first question is always, are we solving the right problem?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are we getting the right answer to the right problem?
[SPEAKER_04]: So once we determine that that is true, that we've identified the right problem,
[SPEAKER_04]: and we have some kind of definition or objective as the right answer, now we can build a plan to get there, and we go backwards.
[SPEAKER_04]: The last step is we test to see if it works.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then the one before that is we train to see if we can actually do the thing so that we can run the test, or we test the thing, and then we train ourselves how to do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, can you drive that car?
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you fit in that car?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I know it's a dumb example, but why would I choose as some objective a car that I cannot get into?
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be kind of like, that's a stupid way of solving the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So... Like me driving a Ferrari at six foot ten inches tall, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly!
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, unless you're Dennis Rodman, because I saw him get out of a Ferrari and I thought, what?
[SPEAKER_04]: How the hell did you even get it?
[SPEAKER_04]: He folded himself.
[SPEAKER_00]: His nickname was the worm.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah But yeah, I mean yes, you know George, you know, it's it's funny because Like okay speaking of large I'm six two.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not a I'm not a basketball sized guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I okay I'm the size of the shortest guy on the team and
[SPEAKER_04]: The shortest guy in the point guard is about my size.
[SPEAKER_04]: 6'2", 6'3", 6'4", around that size.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when you see basketball, the shortest guy on the team is my size.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I still have problems getting into lots of cars.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I watched this thing about Shaq.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, Shaq's seven foot tall.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a huge, ginormous human being.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, and he's not just seven foot tall.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's not like, you know, Yao Ming, where he's tall and lanky.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shaq's just a big, giant mountain of a man, and he's seven foot tall.
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw him get into a, what is the Mercedes,
[SPEAKER_04]: square boxy thing, whatever that's called, a G-Wagon.
[SPEAKER_04]: He got into that and I thought, it looks like me getting into a regular-sized car, him getting into that thing, and he was squeezing himself into it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, man, God, can you imagine what it's like for him to buy cars?
[SPEAKER_04]: They've gotta be just, you know, the biggest version of whatever they have so that it's just a normal car to him.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, that was just a fascinating, fascinating picture.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, thanks.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's going on, Hoops?
[SPEAKER_04]: I got just a couple minutes left.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything exciting today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Andy, sorry, I was just trying to get back to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just, you know, building out my,
[SPEAKER_00]: my newsletter, writing some articles, um, and, and getting, getting ready for, um, for tonight, uh, the room tonight at seven, uh, doing the reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think we might have one or two more sessions and doing, you know, just doing some, some reviews on that and creating, creating art.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started a new TikTok channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'm trying to follow, um, the lazy Canadians, uh, advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I built a new TikTok channel, um, to simplify,
[SPEAKER_00]: I found a cool way where I can do 10 videos a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to be short.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't do 10 one minute videos a day or two, three one minute videos a day is good, but it weighs on, after a while it weighs on me, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of the amount of work I put into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm using the five and the 10 second videos, one prompt to tell short stories about my new brand, which is my newsletter, which is the athletic entrepreneur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So each of those little,
[SPEAKER_00]: little short stories now can can be one prompt that just hasn't have a character doing a little exercise move and i've been able to get these characters to do little little movements so i'm gonna i'm gonna inundate that that instagram account with pot i mean that tiktok account with the possibility of 10 per day and get the volume up there because um uh what do you know his his his blueprint was you know after doing that for about a year what is that he got about what 40 50 000
[SPEAKER_00]: So and he said he never even had to had to Engaged he just posted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, I started a new account and there's already a little traction Of course, you know tik-tok always give you a little traction to keep you excited So I'm riding on that now and building out this My newsletter appreciate you for asking.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, excellent I had the early part of this space.
[SPEAKER_04]: I basically said email and your phone
[SPEAKER_04]: Your mobile phone and your email address are the two-factor authentication for you to get into everything, including your bank, your insurance, your whatever, government agencies.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the way that we make all of our connections.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, if somebody passes away in your family, do not shut off their phone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep it around for a while.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to find all kinds of stuff that they were doing
[SPEAKER_04]: Not bad, like, you know, a credit card failed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you didn't even know they had an account with that company, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're gonna need, that's how the systems are kind of built today.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, let's go to Famous.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's going on, Famous?
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, Andy, good to see you and everybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: A rainy, crappy afternoon in Montreal, but life is good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Morale is good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Plugging away, doing the work, doing the stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: I do not have a systematic method to build a brand, but I have a brand and I'm kind of building it on the fly.
[SPEAKER_06]: I kind of discovered it on the fly and I'm building it on the fly and taking in knowledge as I come across it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You've been very helpful in that respect and applying it where it does apply.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm very much learning as I go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, let me let me give you here's the brand blueprint.
[SPEAKER_04]: The first three steps are to define your voice, choose your niche audience, and talk about your superpower.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you've missed any of that, go back, listen to the recordings and or come tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll talk about it again.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just going to talk about the same stuff right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Every day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are the three things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Using those three things, you can create your own voice because you can personalize the content in your voice, customize it towards your audience, and talk about the things that you solve with your superpower.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, that's why those three things work.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, here's how you do it, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Now here's the systematic way to hack the algorithms.
[SPEAKER_04]: Number one, create a brand
[SPEAKER_04]: Create a web page in your name.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your own blog in your name.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hit me up and I'll tell you exactly how to do this or if you want I'll put this together.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you go get your domain.
[SPEAKER_04]: You put it on one of the cheap blog platforms, and you write something every day.
[SPEAKER_04]: It could be a paragraph, it could be a quote, it could be anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: You put some content out every single day because the algorithms like consistency of posting, consistency of message, and consistency of your voice.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you put something out every single day.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you put it out on your blog, and you put it out on LinkedIn, and you put three or four posts on X, and they're all about the same topic,
[SPEAKER_04]: and you do that every day for 30 days, 60 days, 90 days, whatever search criteria you had before will be massively amplified and you will get closer and closer to being in the top of that list.
[SPEAKER_04]: Either when they search for your name, or they search for the topic, or they search for how do you solve this problem,
[SPEAKER_04]: Yours, your content will continue to grow and grow and grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when we say digital brand, we're really talking about, or we say personal brand, we're really talking about a digital persona.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your digital twin, what people find when they Google you, when they perplexity search you, when they run a Bing search or a DuckDuckGo search or whatever the latest, the newest one's gonna be, whatever the latest search engine is gonna end up being.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is the most effective way to get from where you are to higher.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you do that consistently, you will continue to climb in those rankings and you'll be served when people ask for those kind of questions on every platform.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you can't ever promise you're gonna get to number one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if you want to get to number one in crowdsource commercial real estate, you have to overcome somebody like Chris Krohn or Grant Cardone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Grant Cardone has been producing 10, 20, 30 pieces of content every day for 10 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to have to produce 50,000 pieces of content to overcome what he's done.
[SPEAKER_04]: But he's still doing today, and he's probably doing more today than he did yesterday.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to start, you have to pick your niche, and you have to start creating content.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the systematic method to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's proof.
[SPEAKER_04]: I dropped some proof on how I get consulting companies, and I get companies to hire my company to do work for them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I dropped proof on here's how you can generate.
[SPEAKER_04]: I generated millions of page views on my blog.
[SPEAKER_04]: All organic, no promotions, no paid ads, using this exact same method, and I'm just giving it to everybody for free.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want my help, I have a very simple thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like $97 a month.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want me to do a bunch of it for you, I can do that for about $600 a month.
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not an offer.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just telling you, that's kind of what I'm charging and what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're interested in that, hit me up and I'll put you into the system and how the whole thing works and you can figure out if you want to do it or not.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you guys, the people on here, you're not really my target audience.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm probably going to hit you up in the next
[SPEAKER_04]: 90 days, you're probably gonna get a DM from me that said, hey, I'm doing this cool thing, if you're interested in getting an audit, click here, and it'll take you to a landing page, and then it'll start off the funnel and you can do your thing if you want.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're probably gonna get one of those, but if not, don't be offended if I haven't got to you yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, did that help answer your question, Famous?
[SPEAKER_06]: Very.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, it did.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_06]: I already have my domain and I think I'll start a rocket and rolling as of, as of right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks very much, Andy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And starting it is the most important thing and then making it better.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can help make it better later.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause you know, there's lots of, all of that, you know, kind of sophisticated, but you know, the reality is.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't have anything, you're level zero.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's start with level one.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have a domain.
[SPEAKER_04]: You write some stuff on a blog.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, now, how do we make the blog a little better?
[SPEAKER_04]: We go from level one to level 10.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're on level 10.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do we get people to answer and comment on the blog?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's from level 10 to level 20 or 25.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, oh, how do I get people interested and more people talk?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's going from level 25 to level 50.
[SPEAKER_04]: All the stuff I talk about is level 0 to level 1, level 1 to level 10.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_04]: All the stuff we talk about is the lowest possible level of everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want the sophisticated stuff, we can go deep and wide on that later.
[SPEAKER_04]: But right now, start a blog in your name.
[SPEAKER_04]: Put stuff on it consistently.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when you start, don't stop.
[SPEAKER_04]: 5,000, 10,000 people following me on X in the first two years.
[SPEAKER_04]: The first year I wrote a blog, I had 50, 75 people read it and comment on it every day.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I stopped doing it for 15 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I know I'm dumb.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just means I did it once, I can do it again.
[SPEAKER_04]: So can you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not that hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not difficult.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing we're talking about is rocket science.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just takes the ability to commit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And here's the hard part.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to be willing to have people point and laugh at you.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to- I'm so down with that.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's fine.
[SPEAKER_06]: No problem there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to be willing
[SPEAKER_04]: to have people point at you and laugh at you, because that's where they're going to start.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're doing what?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, what makes you think you can do that?
[SPEAKER_04]: You just ignore them and keep going.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a year later, you can say crazy things like, you know, 50,000 people have read my website.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, you know, a couple years later, whatever it is, you can tell them even other numbers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or they can go read it themselves.
[SPEAKER_04]: They can join your newsletter and read everything you post every week.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they can criticize you and be critical of you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Listen, if you don't have haters, you're not standing for anything important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, Will, let's get some last thoughts here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just going to say that one thing that I heartily encourage is to have an element of tactical delusion, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, which is, which is, you know, something about you that other people cannot yet see, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you have a vision, and the other people around you are all going to look at that through the lens of their own conditioning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you break out of the old conditioning, you're not going to be in with the crowd, you're going to stand out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And being forewarned and forearmed with an element of tactical delusion means I see greater for myself than you all see for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can all do it too, if you're willing to pay the price.
[SPEAKER_01]: The price is to give up the old programming, to give up the old self.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this, I mean, a lot of successful people talk about this, that you've got to, and again, you know how much I feel about the biblical side of this, but we'll keep it on task.
[SPEAKER_01]: Having the ability to have faith in something that you cannot see requires delusion.
[SPEAKER_01]: It requires being de-illusioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the illusion is the old self.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the, it's what you see around you, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if there were, if, if you took the world at face value, you would never move beyond what you could see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Neville Goddard used to say it really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said those that continue to obey the evidence of their senses will continue to be enslaved by them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you've got to go beyond what you can see for yourself and aspire to greater and no one around you will
[SPEAKER_01]: cheer you on if they're all at a level that is potentially below or at a level that is conditioned to be a certain place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because nothing's good or bad, nothing's right or wrong, there is no morality in nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just circumstance and interpretation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the idea being
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to be willing to stand out in order to be different than your environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that will require of you the ability to let go of the desire to fit in, which is a very hardwired human desire.
[SPEAKER_01]: So have an element of tactical delusion and find a team that has your back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that will make the process of outgrowing your environment so much easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's my final thought for today.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so true.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, faith is believing the evidence you can't see.
[SPEAKER_04]: And ironically, Chamath, I don't know how to say his last name, starts with a P, Palmatier or something like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Forgive me for saying it wrong.
[SPEAKER_04]: But he was one of the original executives at Facebook, multi, he's a billionaire, multi
[SPEAKER_04]: huge amounts of investments, huge amounts of financial understanding.
[SPEAKER_04]: He, today, maybe it was in the last All In podcast, he's one of those guys, he said, the thing that I wish everybody would have told me is that I'm just, that we're just like everybody else.
[SPEAKER_04]: He said, because when you start to take a leadership role, you will fall into the trap of
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody's better than me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I suck.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm so bad at this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the truth is, you're not better than anyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're definitely not worse than anyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're just in the role.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're just willing to carry that mantle.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you're willing to carry the mantle, it will come with insecurity.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's where the faith piece comes in.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what he said was so brilliant.
[SPEAKER_04]: He said, you need to have a group of people either far enough away that they can encourage you or so close that they can encourage you to just keep going.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you're not different.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not better.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're definitely not worse than everybody else.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're just carrying a different mantle.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're just carrying a different responsibility.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you want to be an entrepreneur,
[SPEAKER_04]: And I encourage everyone to do that because the world needs you, it needs magic, it needs entrepreneurs.
[SPEAKER_04]: The world will not operate at all without this entrepreneurial spirit and people willing to take it on and carry it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the reason I know that is because, like each of you, I've been on my knees praying to God to solve my problems.
[SPEAKER_04]: and my problems were solved by somebody else who said, you know, I can do that really easily for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't cost very much money and it's pretty simple and I can do it in a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Instead of me thinking, this is impossible, I don't know how to do it, I don't know where to start, and I'll never get it done, and even if I do get it done, it'll probably be terrible.
[SPEAKER_04]: And somebody else goes, oh, that's no big deal, I can fix that, it takes a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's easy for them and impossible for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the truth is that every single one of us has that amazing gift.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's no problem for us and impossible for other people.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so my encouragement to you is, those people who are on their knees, like you and I have been, we're not gonna get served if you don't take your torch, light it, and carry it out into the dark, cold world.
[SPEAKER_04]: People need the light, they need their answers solved, and they're willing to pay you to solve their problems.
[SPEAKER_04]: So pick up your torch, carry it out into the dark world.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, I'm your biggest fan.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, see you guys tomorrow.
