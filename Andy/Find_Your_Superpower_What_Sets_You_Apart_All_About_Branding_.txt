[SPEAKER_00]: All right, good afternoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is Wednesday, November 5th.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, remember the 5th of November.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gunpowder treason.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I love that whole idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the fact that people are willing to look at injustice and say, nope, that's not it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not what we're doing today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm interested in what
[SPEAKER_00]: your superpower is.
[SPEAKER_00]: What sets you apart?
[SPEAKER_00]: What sets you apart in finding your superpower?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me be real brief in what a superpower is.
[SPEAKER_00]: A superpower is something that you do naturally, easily, without effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so easy for you, you think everybody can do it and yet other people can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most interesting part is the idea that some people have these superpowers and
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody has them, but they don't think they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody does things naturally so easily, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people can just go into a room and realize exactly who's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people can listen to a conversation and understand exactly how.
[SPEAKER_00]: the person is thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people can just see someone walking and say, oh, they're injured, or they're hurt, or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people look at a computer and think, and it doesn't work, and they go, oh, I'll just click this little thing over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people look at a car and listen to it and go, oh, the timing's off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every one of us has some thing
[SPEAKER_00]: or a couple things that we do naturally that are just obvious to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that I've been able to do is take a giant
[SPEAKER_00]: list of things or a whole garage or a messy room and just go, okay, this stuff goes over there, this stuff goes over here, and I'm just able to kind of put it in a way that is, to me, obvious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not to everybody, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so being able to just take a bunch of mess and turn it into some kind of structure, which by the way is not that great, but I can turn it into something that other people can see and know and understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is one of my superpowers, but I would love to hear, so please, like this space, promote this space, repost it, ask your friends to come, because I really want to find out what your superpowers are, what sets you apart, because this is what you need to determine how you can add value to other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the way, it's not the fact that
[SPEAKER_00]: I built a prompt that I can, you know, put this thing in and get some result at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's not what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm talking about is the thing that you is easy for you, that your parents said, like, my brother was awesome at memorizing things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when we're driving in the car, back in the day, my mom would say, Oh, hey, remember this phone number, and he would just remember it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right and then hours later somebody would say hey, what was that phone number of the thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw and he would just tell him That was one of his superpowers Because he had this just amazing capacity to remember just voluminous amounts of information like you know the guys Like if you want to be on trivial pursuit or play any of those kind of memory games.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you got to pick him first because
[SPEAKER_00]: He'll know and remember everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, yeah, so let's talk about what is your superpower, what sets you apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way in context this whole thing works, while everybody's still joining, is that in order to define you as a brand, you need to pick three things.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is your voice?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you want to be heard?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who is your audience?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who do you want to talk to?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what is your superpower?
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to pick them up front, but eventually they will become clear and obvious as your brand becomes more obvious.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the brand becomes obvious when your superpower, the things you do easily and well, other people need you to do that for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other people who need you to do it for them, that ends up being your audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way that you describe it, that's your voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead of me just telling you to do the scariest thing on earth to every single human, which is, can you just go up here and start talking?
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people are freaked out about that, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I go around it the other way, and I ask, well, who do you want to talk to?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what things do you do that are super awesome and that everybody else thinks are super awesome, and you can help other people with those things?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are those things for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I would love for you to take a little courage, grab the mic, ask a question, or tell me what your superpower is.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll figure out how we can help you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my opener for the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go to Mullet.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going on, Mullet?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, how's it going?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is your superpower?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that is a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something I've been trying to figure out more.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's interesting how it's easy to look at what other people are doing and see their superpower, but I feel like looking towards your own is kind of a harder thing for you to find sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Isn't that always true?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's always true.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so much more difficult to look in the mirror and go, okay, what am I really good at?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the things you think you're really good at,
[SPEAKER_00]: the stuff that are just easy for you you think everyone they're easy for everyone they're they're not just what is it that's easy for you to do like did you have did you was there a subject in school here's an easy way to do the evaluation was there a subject in school that you just went you never had to study you as soon as they finished talking you had you had the answer you knew exactly what they were talking about in your brain
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an easy one for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'd be math.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why, but math, math just clicks for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it, it's so funny cause it goes back to like my fifth grade teacher.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, he made me write out my sets from zero times zero to 12 times 12 every time I got in trouble.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I learned, I learned my times tables pretty fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So math just, it just clicks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like the old question of if you added every number together from one to a hundred, how, what is the total?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easy, you do 99 plus one, 98 plus two, and you do all of those, 100 and zero and 50.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have 50 of them plus 50 left over, so you have 5,050 is the answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But doing the logical solving, that's something people do, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing the math in your head, if I said what's 14 times 17, some people can go, oh, it's this number, I don't remember what that number is, calculator.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some people can just answer that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not the times tables that we all learned, but just beyond that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the square root of 27?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they just go, oh, it's this number.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people can switch from fractions to percentages, and from percentages to fractions, and never miss a beat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I saw Honey Badger.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was gonna bring her up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the obvious superpowers, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody looks at academically and says, okay, great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you another superpower that some people have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people have the ability to tell if someone's lying or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like human lie detectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a superpower, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not one of those people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to really work and think about it and listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some people can just go, oh, liar, liar, pencil fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you go, but everything they're saying is true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nope, it's a lie.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then eventually you find out they were right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you, and here's another thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: To find your superpower, you need to do something like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is so obvious that I use that skill, that superpower, every single day, every possible way I can?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you another example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's heard the story of the electrician who fixes everyone's stuff and it's perfect and yet their house has outlets hanging out and other things hanging over and the kitchen isn't fully wired.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it all works, it's just not done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their superpower is fixing and solving things
[SPEAKER_00]: And they use that superpower to create worth in their own life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as long as there's something to fix, they have value.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is why the cobbler whose kids don't have shoes, or the electrician whose house isn't fully wired, but everything kind of works, they're using that superpower as a way to validate their own self.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why this whole conversation is hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because most people use their superpower to get value and appreciation and ultimately attention and love from other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not entirely true, as I've learned as I got older, but we typically do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have something in your life
[SPEAKER_00]: that you can do for everybody else and in your own life is kind of a little bit of a mess, that might be your superpower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just, you need to work on the mindset a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's what we're gonna do next week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today we're just talking about what is it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's write down your superpower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two or three of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, if you have one superpower that solves one problem that's really important to one group of people, you can make millions and millions and millions of dollars solving one problem for one group of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people think they need to do everything for everybody and therefore do nothing for nobody and have no monetization.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so mullet, give me one thing
[SPEAKER_00]: Of all the things I've mentioned so far, what is one of the things that you do or you think about that is your superpower?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, it's still kind of a tough one for me to answer right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lately, I've been getting back on like a health and fitness type kick for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've been more posted about that and doing spaces around that just to try to help to inspire other people to do to get back more healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd say something around that maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's a desire, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a problem you're solving, but that's not your superpower.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it about, okay, let's look at it a different way.
[SPEAKER_00]: People who are addicted to alcohol, or they're addicted to pornography, or they're addicted to cigarettes, or drugs, or overworking, whatever it is, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the result of the thing that they're avoiding But they only use their superpower to do that thing That make sense Um, yeah, okay, so If you're really good at math You don't have to work at math You can do math anytime anybody asks you stuff I'll bet you build your schedule based on
[SPEAKER_00]: the count up of time blocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably know how many billable hours there are in a week, how many seconds there are in a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably know how many stairs are in the house, how many doors there are, how far it is to drive from work to home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know those kind of things?
[SPEAKER_01]: I am for the most part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, which means your superpower is the ability to calculate all those things Instantaneously so you can do crazy things like well How long is it gonna take to get from here to there and you can instantly go?
[SPEAKER_00]: Normally, I drive at 35 miles an hour and it's you know, 17 miles away So it's gonna take this amount of time but if you put in a buffer for track you can tell probably down to the minute how long it's gonna take because You're using your superpower of math
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you have a tendency to kind of look at everything through the lens of, because I'm able to calculate stuff quickly and easily, and I'm mostly right, I use that superpower for everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recipes, how much does it cost when you go to the grocery store, when you're walking around, can you afford this one or that one?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just calculate what you've got in the basket so far, plus that one to say, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: you have a tendency to use this superpower all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I close?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd say you're pretty spot on.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, one of my other superpowers is observation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spent almost a decade working outside the United States in other parts of the world
[SPEAKER_00]: where English was their second language.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I lived and worked and operated, not operated, that's the wrong word.
[SPEAKER_00]: I lived and worked there and had to exist in their society without knowing much of their language.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned other languages badly, but I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I observed that people are pretty much people
[SPEAKER_00]: Everywhere you go except for maybe a little bit of culture and a little bit of language, but in reality the reactions between people are pretty consistent and so that that Heightened The fact that I have the observational skill, so I'm just using that observational skill talk about branding talk about other people's superpowers talk about a
[SPEAKER_00]: what you can or can't or how you do those kind of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one of my things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see the picture and then organize it into functional kind of areas to structure that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one of my superpowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I already mentioned that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just another example of how you use your superpower.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only reason I'm bringing this up is so that each one of you can evaluate and listen and think, what is my superpower?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the way that I do things?
[SPEAKER_00]: I call that operating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't mean it to being like a spy or something weird like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just talking about the way you logically or the way that you go through life and the way that you handle and deal with all the things you deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I mean by operating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way you operate in your life
[SPEAKER_00]: relies upon your ability to solve some of those problems with your superpower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people it's all about relationships.
[SPEAKER_00]: They instantly understand where the other person is.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know what they're feeling and they navigate their life by watching other people's feelings and then amplifying those for the things that they want to get done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_00]: Other people do it by
[SPEAKER_00]: math.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other people do it by they're capable of seeing the intent beyond what the actual activities are.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are people who typically are people who do any type of a forecasting job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Project managers, the guys that build the actuary tables, the stock prognosticators, the guys that pick
[SPEAKER_00]: the they set the lines for the games the gambling guys the
[SPEAKER_00]: The people who talk about, you know, fantasy.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are people who have the ability to see beyond what's the obvious in front and they can see the next two or three steps, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They do that kind of job.
[SPEAKER_00]: People who are all relationship-based, they're more like the person who stands on the street and says, hey, what do you think about this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you, you, come here, come here, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I want to talk to you about this question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, here's the quote.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to turn the camera on, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're that kind of person.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the salespeople.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the people who are the best waiters and waitresses.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're also people who can look at stuff and go, oh, that food is going to, oh, no, we can't cook that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's not going to work right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they just know how it all operates together, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I'm giving you every example I can think of so that I'm hoping for some hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see Brenda.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know how to say this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kayuk?
[SPEAKER_00]: I am Kayuki?
[SPEAKER_00]: Boy, I love that name, but I just don't know how to say it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, Brenda.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead, Kayuki.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll go to Brenda next.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you say it?
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, yeah, it's kweek.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Q-U-I-K, kweek?
[SPEAKER_07]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you're almost there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Kuwek.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kuwek.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kuwek.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are you from, Kuwek?
[SPEAKER_07]: Nigeria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Up north or in Lagos?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, you know Lagos?
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit, yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_07]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Ed, anyway,
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your thoughts?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is your superpower?
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you so much, Andy.
[SPEAKER_07]: And thank you so much, Moulet.
[SPEAKER_07]: And thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, Brenda.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, Tons.
[SPEAKER_07]: And hi, everyone in the space.
[SPEAKER_07]: I see you.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I have this superpower.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I want to share with us, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: You could you keep going in and out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe the phone is going back and forth from your voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could you try again?
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't hear everything you said.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, can you hear me now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, perfect.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so I'm trying to say that I have a superpower.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time you go to explain it, it becomes muffled.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, I'm just not hearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to, I want to put you down in the listeners, come back as a speaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe X will then give us a clearer connection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll try that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll get you back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, let's go to Brenda and then Vitton's.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, Brenda.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, thank you so much for allowing me to come up.
[SPEAKER_04]: My phone won't turn around.
[SPEAKER_04]: Gosh, darn it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Am I still there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, you're here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clear, loud and clear.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ask the question, please.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ask your question.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is your superpower?
[SPEAKER_00]: What sets you apart?
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: What?
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I have to go to a nursing setting for this because I was a nurse's aide.
[SPEAKER_04]: So my superpower was to be proactive and I could see a problem before it would happen because that was my niche.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is what I did.
[SPEAKER_04]: I worked with old people and sometimes young people.
[SPEAKER_04]: At any rate, they were all psychiatric.
[SPEAKER_04]: My superpower is truly
[SPEAKER_04]: to being able to foresee a problem and probably that the niche that I'm working in.
[SPEAKER_04]: because not only am I thinking for me, and this might be a problem, but I'm also thinking for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we are making an appointment, I need to be inside your head thinking, well, if you told me eight o'clock at night, then I might say to you, oh, are you sure eight o'clock at night?
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's too late, you see?
[SPEAKER_04]: So I tend to, Dr. Heath calls it reading other people's minds, but it can be a superpower for me because I just,
[SPEAKER_04]: think?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think for other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see what they are thinking and what their probable next actions are going to be and then you can tell them or predict to them what's going to happen, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: How else do you use that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you use that with your family, with your kids, with
[SPEAKER_00]: what they want to do, what other things are going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because what I found is people with a super, everybody, by the way, everybody has a superpower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we just rely on those things for all of the problems we solve in life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Brenda, how else have you used that super, think about it, tell me how else you use your superpower.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so now that I do know I don't work outside the home.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't work inside the home other than housework My superpower is used I I'm sorry, dr. Heath, but I predict personalities.
[SPEAKER_04]: I predict outcomes and I do it Fully based on interactions with myself and or others Is that too cocky?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the point I'm trying to help everyone with.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can describe your superpower, you can start telling people that you can do whatever that thing is and apply it in a way that other people need help.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a ton of people in the world who need an assistant, a trusted advisor that they can talk to and who can say,
[SPEAKER_00]: Seems like it's going to go down this path.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see if that actually happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it does, now you become one of those kind of prognosticator people about the human interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not jealous of it, but it's very cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'm jealous of it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's just admit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, Brenda.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Dr. Heath would say I don't have that power.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, Dr. Heath.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I will say having that power, in my opinion, has helped me dodge a lot of bullets.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm grateful for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we could call it a superpower.
[SPEAKER_04]: We could call it a Spidey Sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: We could call it whatever you want, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that is what I think is my superpower.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much for allowing me to come up and share.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you're welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're always welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I appreciate that you come and listen all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using your superpower is one of the three things that I talk about when you're creating your personal brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's your audience?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is your superpower?
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, what, how can you help them solve the problems?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what voice do you want to be known by?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is your real authentic, true voice that we talked about that yesterday?
[SPEAKER_00]: of your voice, you know, we change voices and languages based on going from room to room or from location to location or person to person.
[SPEAKER_00]: We change the way we speak, we change the vocabulary we use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you
[SPEAKER_00]: The older you get, the more of a mimic you can become, meaning you can talk to salespeople one way and then turn and talk to your children a different way, turn right back and talk to the salespeople, and just instantly switch languages.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my point is, you still need to be authentically you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a difficult thing to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's also a difficult thing for people to look in the mirror and recognize, this is my superpower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we talked to mullet mullet can do math in his head.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he has a tendency to look at the world through the lens of numbers and calculations and math and structure and that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look at things like I, the world to me is gray, and I want to organize it to be either black or white.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, like, these things are a mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's just a big pile in the garage, it doesn't make any sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I organize all the things by size, that's one way to make it obvious.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one way to make it, you know, either black or white, not gray, not just a mess in the middle, not darker gray or lighter gray, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I organize them by color, that's a different way to structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I organize it by,
[SPEAKER_00]: function, maybe that's a different way to look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The point is, right now it's just a pile of junk in the middle of the garage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't help anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't provide any utility or purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have a tendency to drive all of those things towards making it purposeful or utilitarian or functional or at least structured so that anybody looks at it can go, oh, well obviously they're all by color, so let's pick the blue ones if we want the blue ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we all have a tendency to use our superpower to kind of frame our world in a way that makes sense to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm simply trying to point out that you all have one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You all use it every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just maybe haven't thought about it in the way I'm describing it to put it in vocabulary so that you can then look at it and say, what can I offer the world?
[SPEAKER_00]: you can offer the world your superpower as it applies to those other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, Brenda.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just settled down on me.
[SPEAKER_04]: What is my superpower that I can offer to the world?
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, when I look at it like that, I wouldn't be able to tell you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think of it this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You solve problems and we all solve other people's problems whenever they're presented to us using our superpowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I asked you to come up and grab the mic and tell me about your superpowers, speaking in public is one of the most fearful things in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead of me asking you to come up and tell me, blah, blah, blah, I'm asking you, look in the mirror.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you solve those problems?
[SPEAKER_00]: How did you resolve that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have some inspiration like, oh, the light bulb just went off, grab the mic and tell me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, let's go to Vtonz.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the way, you guys got to correct me.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I say your name wrong, just correct me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm totally cool with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vtonz Graphics, how you doing?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Andy, I'm fine, by the way.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good pronunciation, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: What's your superpower?
[SPEAKER_06]: What sets you apart?
[SPEAKER_06]: So my superpower is teaching actually.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just like to carry people along and share my knowledge and just impact basically.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like to impact lives positively, you know, like carry people around me along and all of that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually started a YouTube channel about three months ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: just so I could preach and share the mutual knowledge I have about graphic design.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so far, like, every time I post my stuff here on X, I always get a lot of DMs, like people reaching out to me, telling me how they love my art and all of that, and they would just like to learn and just get to the level that I currently am in.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I've been thinking about it a lot, and I've also decided to start a community
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't have to be much.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have to just bring a couple of people together and you know just each group and share stuff and just all about personal goods and all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so let's let's break this down for a moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: requires a bunch of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It requires you to communicate an idea from your brain to somebody else's.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it also requires it to be in a way that the audience who receives the communication is inspired or understands or has some additional context of knowledge, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so is your superpower, quote unquote, teaching, or is your superpower the fact that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: organize something and then communicate it in a way that other people understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are different.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have much trouble actually like communicating stuff in a way that people can understand them.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens when somebody, so when you're, when you're talking to someone and you're teaching them and they,
[SPEAKER_00]: Hesitate or they don't nod at the moment you expect them to how do you handle that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, if if I'm if I'm teaching and I Figure that the person is kind of lost or is not following.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take a pause for a minute Do you do you change or do you just tell them again I
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you a dumb example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me give you a very dumb example.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is example for everyone to listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I said, Vitan, are you sure you're teaching?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is it really just communicating?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you kind of hesitate and I go and I just make it louder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you sure you're teaching?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or are you can you see that's how how dumb that is, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm simply saying it again, as if you don't understand me.
[SPEAKER_00]: A different way to approach it is to, as an example, a different way to approach it is to say, so you've understood a topic so well that you can communicate it to people at whatever language level they're at.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they only understand at a third grade level, you can talk to them about the concept at a third grade level.
[SPEAKER_00]: or at a high school level or a university level, but you understand the topic so well that you can express it to them in simple or complex terms.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a different way of describing how to solve the problem than just, I speak slower and louder as if you can't get it, as if you're not getting it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I get the logic behind what you just did.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's literally what I try to do.
[SPEAKER_06]: I try to come down to people's level.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, just being in a way that they can probably understand.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe using simpler words or in a layman's term, their own level to get them to grasp what I'm trying to communicate to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you talk to people and you're teaching them and they
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not getting the message the way you expect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think it's because you're explaining it at a more complicated level than they understand or at a different language level?
[SPEAKER_00]: Concept complication or language complication?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which one do you think it is?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's concepts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You try to just go too far down the road too fast.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I guess because people learn differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, always.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all are at a different level all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people are further down the knowledge trail than we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some people have just started the knowledge trail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every one of you is ahead of me in something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every one of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: My goal is to help you understand that you are amazing and fantastic and you have something extremely valuable to give.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the thing that is the most valuable to give you dismiss because you think it's so easy everybody probably has it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your ability to understand things and communicate them is a superpower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can apply that superpower in many, many different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go back to Brenda.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, Brenda.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm coming up to bat three times because I really feel like we are not getting this for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think this is what you need to hear.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it, and I believe this is what I want to say.
[SPEAKER_04]: find your superpower.
[SPEAKER_04]: What sets you apart?
[SPEAKER_04]: What sets you apart?
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, what sets me apart from everybody else on this X?
[SPEAKER_04]: I can honestly say just my style.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so that's, that is my superpower because no one can steal my style.
[SPEAKER_04]: Doesn't matter how much they try because I come up with one every week.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, but seriously,
[SPEAKER_04]: My superpower, I really believe, is my style.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I don't know if that's what you're getting at, but I am also trying to hone in this, my brand.
[SPEAKER_04]: My brand for the simple fact that anybody could research me.
[SPEAKER_04]: My children could be getting jobs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's check out the parents.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I keep
[SPEAKER_04]: personal brand straight simply because it's who I am and for for those reasons as well so I'm caring but my superpower is going to be my style all right final answer that's great the the answer by the way there is no final answer there is no right and there definitely isn't any wrong right the
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole point of this discussion today is that each one of you are special.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each one of you is dismissive of your natural gifts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know this is true.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've worked with thousands and thousands of people and every one of them has some awesome, unique, unbelievably cool thing that they're able to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every one of them uses it every day to solve the problems and to navigate their life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet, that is the one thing that they should amplify in their personal brand, because that one thing is what is missing from everybody else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because I can look at a pile of stuff in the garage and kind of make it into something that makes sense,
[SPEAKER_00]: Other people can do better, different things than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other people can look at it and organize it by price or size or different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may organize it one way that makes sense to me and different, you can organize it differently, makes sense to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the ability to do that, we all use our superpowers every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: and most people don't recognize what they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm simply trying to shed light on the fact that you have superpowers and you're using them every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we talked about mullet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mullet can do math at a different level than most people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So mullet goes through life looking at everything through the lens of numbers and calculations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other people can go through life and look at things about
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it make sense?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it organized?
[SPEAKER_00]: Other people, and that's like me, other people can go through like Brenda and go, well, I can kind of figure out what you're going to do next just by talking to you and seeing you and just getting a sense of what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe I'm more right than wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's tremendously powerful.
[SPEAKER_00]: The point is everybody has something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody does that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you find out what it is, and you write it down, it will become obvious to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also obvious if you think it's something like, well, I can write prompts really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, maybe you can imagine what the engineers were writing when they built the system so that you can understand why what you're doing works better than other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or when you're playing a video game, you can understand why the programmers designed or the product managers designed that level of problem in a certain way so that you can go, oh, they only have this constrained set of tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, these are the tools that they only have access to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, these are the only tools that I need to worry about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the right combination of tools to solve this particular level?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are people who do that without any conscious thought instantly and know the answer, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at great sports people, American football, soccer players.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does Messi know exactly where to place the pass, exactly how hard to hit it so that it ends up on the foot of his teammate in the right spot at the right time?
[SPEAKER_00]: He doesn't even look.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does he do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because his superpower is he sees the things that other people don't see.
[SPEAKER_00]: He sees those next two or three steps that other people don't see either.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how he's able to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he's practiced that for all of these decades of hours and hours and hours of games and practice and everything else to refine that where he uses his superpower of seeing what people are going to do and then exploits it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great football players do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great American football players do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great pitchers do that in baseball.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great bowlers do it in cricket.
[SPEAKER_00]: On and on and on.
[SPEAKER_00]: The point is that you have a superpower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you can put your superpower into a place where it can be utilized, it becomes like the magic pixie dust of your life that makes everything just seem to happen automatically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want this for every one of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether you want it or not, that's up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether you choose to follow what I say or not, that's up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do, cool, awesome, I'm here for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're my people.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you just want to listen and think I'm full of whatever you want to say I'm full of, that's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's okay too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know for sure what I'm saying is true.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know for sure what I'm saying matters and makes a difference in people's lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the question is, are you going to apply it and make it valuable for you or not?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is what I'm asking.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your superpower and what sets you apart?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you can figure out what that is, now you can start your journey of self-discovery and growth knowing that you can apply that superpower to all your problems and they're probably going to be better than before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, we've got a couple other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reg, I see Reg put his hand up right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going on Reg?
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, brother, I just want to get in here and cook.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, Brendan, good to see you, Brent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, brother, to piggyback off of what you said, as being an ex-sports competitor and playing sports, I always tell myself what kicked me in to endure when I played defensive back.
[SPEAKER_03]: I patterned myself around Ronnie Lott and Lester Hayes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for you youngsters, those are old school players.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were great players, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cut his finger off because he needed to play.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got it, brother.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just to land with this, I thought of what you said about what kicks in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, think of a track star.
[SPEAKER_03]: We all line up and I get it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kudos.
[SPEAKER_03]: We all, mark, set, go.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what kicks a person extra in, like when it's getting down to the 100-yard meter and you about to, what's that extra that gave Michael Johnson that, or that Carl Lewis that, even Bruce Jenner.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead, brother.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to land with that, that, man, you kick A on that when you speak of the, what's that extra supreme power that you bring out and you see it with competitive sports.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, you see it the most obvious in competitive sports, but it's in every single day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in every single person.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is not a person alive that doesn't have a superpower, something they do automatically that is just obvious to them and blind to the rest of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe there's other people who can do the same kind of thing as them, but not exactly like them, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, just, you know, okay, I'll give you another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: musicians.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, there, you know, I love
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the rappers because how the hell do they come up with all that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the freestyle guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: How the heck can they go that fast?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they practice, obviously, but they have a gift, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a gift.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can some people write so well?
[SPEAKER_00]: How can somebody like Quincy Jones listen to all this different kind of music and go, yeah, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, take the drums and make them a little over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Change the bass line to this kind of a bass line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, do it, oh, yeah, yeah, that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he just, he could feel the whole thing because he was a great musician, but as a producer, oh, there's nobody like Quincy Jones ever, anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys don't know who I'm talking about, you can go figure it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just go look it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: He, and it wasn't just one style.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of producers that are great for, you know, jazz or rock or R&B or country or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quincy Jones was great for everything and just amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, he had that ability to easily just see and hear and feel the whole, the whole musical composition and go, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
[SPEAKER_00]: change this and that or whatever, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like maybe if you went back in time and you thought about Beethoven or Mozart, they had the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could see
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the entire orchestra, all of these types of sounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's put them together like this to make this thing do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This beautiful symphony orchestration come out like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see and hear this whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let me just go ahead and put it together, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm using the obvious extreme examples to help you understand you have one of these things inside you.
[SPEAKER_00]: every one of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really just up to you to look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's another crazy thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is really crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time you can't tell what it is about you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need somebody you trust to go, oh, you know, you just do this other thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really do?
[SPEAKER_00]: You do it all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't figure it out on our own.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we need help.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we need people to give us kind of a nudge or direction or encouragement or just point it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all blind.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all have blind spots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every one of the human beings in the world has a blind spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are not different.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are not unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a blind spot just like everybody else.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question is, are you willing to let other people tell you
[SPEAKER_00]: what you do badly and what you do great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, let's go back to Reg, then we'll go to Brenda, then we'll go to Kelvin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I would say this, Andy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's one of my personal supreme powers that I figured out that I accomplished on my own.
[SPEAKER_03]: without no medication.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I was I was paralyzed waist down in 2017.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I sat in a wheelchair for 11 to 15 months.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I got myself a body there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm walking, boxing, I mean, not boxing, hitting the bag doing what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm at the age of 55 just had a birthday.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, brother, I sat in a chair and watch my Eagles.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I had fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you still in a chair?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, not at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I said that to my supreme powers came I walked again.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I'm Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, you got you got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to help me understand what what happened?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it was it a back injury?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it a muscle thing?
[SPEAKER_03]: It was in LA getting off work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop by the store gunshot wound.
[SPEAKER_03]: Long story short.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, stay with me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Long story short, it was a T4 spinal cord injury.
[SPEAKER_03]: It didn't hit the bone fragment, it hit the nerves.
[SPEAKER_03]: So nerve damage was worse than having my whole bone fragment split.
[SPEAKER_03]: Saying that to say, so when I sat in the chair with the quads, I learned about paraplegic and quadriplegics.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I used to go sit and talk to them, but I had an incomplete injury.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in medical terms, incomplete means you got enough to get back.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when my neurosurgeon said, I got some good news and bad news, man, you paralyzed, but you incomplete, you can get it back.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was enough of a seed planted.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's when the Supreme power was kicked in like, okay, I'm going to get out this chair.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it took me a total of 18 months.
[SPEAKER_03]: Walker transitioned to cane, no Walker,
[SPEAKER_03]: Transition from will I still got the wheelchair in my in my my closet.
[SPEAKER_03]: I I told somebody on my anniversary I bring it out every every February 2000 of February I bring it out and show a picture remember this Reggie but landing the plane with this and so when uh when it took me over a total of 18 months, but my point I'm making is I did this with no medication man then post attain and
[SPEAKER_03]: That was one of the strongest drugs I ever took.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if anybody understands, then post the team that's stripped from the pair of Winkle plant and the ginkgo bola that's straight for nerve damage.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you look in the pair of Winkle, you got pair of Winkle on your property, yo, that's a nerve damage killer, straight square biz.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I got that from one of the best neurosurgeons that came from Lebanon is my Lebanese surgeon.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he said that,
[SPEAKER_03]: You basically got preserved energy.
[SPEAKER_03]: You took care of yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also I was athletic, not the top of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: No ego mania swear to God.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is my life and my story.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some of these ladies and these fellas, they know me, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I vibe high, man, because I have no time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know what I.
[SPEAKER_03]: I cheated death.
[SPEAKER_03]: Being on life support, tubes in your mouth inside, I cheated death.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I understood that something had to die in me in order for me to be live again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody know the science in LA, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Y'all know the madness, but not to bore you with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that was what that was, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys have a blessed one, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: So anything is always possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you put the mindset and you got any type of seed planted small, let it grow and hatching.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: to a
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know props to you for doing that and it's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a 49er fan.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like the Eagles, but that's okay You know what I know you got hands because just a stick right there when I when I said what really inspired me was when I used to go to the rehab center and the paraplegics in the quad J police used to look at me like I
[SPEAKER_03]: You're a miracle, Reg.
[SPEAKER_03]: We told you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, screw me.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you do that every day?
[SPEAKER_02]: To hell with Reggie.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the irony was, Andy, they told me that they had to live in their head.
[SPEAKER_03]: They live and they accept.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when I started to live inside my brain, like I always been, that was the power of understanding autism.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what they couldn't understand is ADHD.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm everywhere in my brain.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you're able to be everywhere in my system we ride, because it refused to sit in the chair, it was like, get out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, your ex-girl having sex?
[SPEAKER_02]: No!
[SPEAKER_03]: Get out of here!
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was a fight of demons and spirits and angels coming to say, hey,
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I gotta go, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's emotional, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love you guys, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope you do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come back anytime.
[SPEAKER_00]: Listen, you always have a spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You always have a speaker space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will make space for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come anytime.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what the superpower is?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in your mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do something well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do something easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do something that you put in almost no effort, and you magically kind of just make things happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever that is, that's your superpower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you need to embrace that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're gonna talk about becoming a personal brand, which I talk about every day, which is you need a personal brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a personal brand to get a job.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a personal brand to monetize yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a personal brand so that you can become all that you want to become.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only people who have the downside of a personal brand are people who are ultimately ultra, ultra wealthy, and everybody wants a piece of their money, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the only time when a personal brand's probably, you know, not helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every other time, there's no downside to having a personal brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially if you can say, I stand for this, I don't stand for these other things, I disagree with them, I stand positively for this stuff, I wanna do these kind of things, this is what I do, this is how I help people, this is how I wanna help you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may not want my help right now, that's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you want my help,
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually, I'm still gonna be here and I'm still gonna be offering something, though if you buy it today, it's probably a lot cheaper than you buy in the future because by the future, I'm gonna have a lot more clients and I'm gonna have to raise my prices so that my time's still valuable.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you find things that work, you find stuff that helps, go all in on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the one thing, the three things you need, you need to determine your voice,
[SPEAKER_00]: And I call this your brand blueprint, your brand blueprint, your personal brand blueprint is your voice, your audience, and your superpower.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about today, Ben, what is your superpower?
[SPEAKER_00]: Your superpower is between your ears, the thing that you do well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, let's go to Kelvin real quick and then back to Brendan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably have to end it up here because I'm going to be done in five minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's going on, Kelvin?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Andy, thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so very much for the space.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so very much.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, you're loud and clear.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, so I actually want to ask the question and it's someone's someone sort of.
[SPEAKER_05]: Should I say?
[SPEAKER_05]: A line of thoughts, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So.
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually got.
[SPEAKER_05]: like I got drop of a face subsequently while you were speaking so I don't know if you've actually mentioned this or talked about this previously so I would actually love to know can we classify gift and talent as a superpower like can that be called a form of a superpower and also can can we have more than one superpower because actually I feel while you were talking I had to like think and I was like
[SPEAKER_05]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Although I've had these thoughts and I know exactly what I'm good at.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it just brought me to, um, uh, thinking down what I know, like I'm very good at comes very easily to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, um, I know very well that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got, I got you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first, the first thing is of course, everybody has more than one superpower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I usually try to only highlight two or three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the way I look at it is, to create a personal brand, meaning a digital presence, blog, ex-posts, LinkedIn, et cetera, you need to pick a particular topic and you need to be solving one problem for one group of people, but you should solve that problem with your superpower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason you solve that with your superpower is because it doesn't take a lot of effort for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easy to understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easy to gather.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you speak, you can speak with authority and authenticity about the things you do, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm six foot two inches tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, that's taller than most people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not a superpower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm athletic, I can jump and pick up stuff and throw things pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not a superpower either, being athletic, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Being able to help people see what they can see, what is in their minds, that's a superpower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being able to communicate an idea across all of the countries and continents and time zones that we have people on this
[SPEAKER_00]: There are at least five different countries, three different continents for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That might be a superpower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Communication across things to help people understand what they can do, that's encouragement.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a superpower.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Kelvin, what are your superpowers?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the question.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I actually believe my, my superpower is perspective.
[SPEAKER_05]: I see things as different lenses and I feel it makes me make a better informed decision.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, it's, I think that's actually one of the things that does, um, my ability in marketing, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I don't just take decision.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hear people talk, right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when they just talk like this, I'll just do,
[SPEAKER_05]: like they're focusing on one aspect of that topic, like that's that's subject rights, but I tend to look at it like from other angles, so like I see things are different perspective combined, bring them up together and I just feel it makes me make informed and better decisions, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Kevin, Andy, let me help you out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Over here, Kev, we like Captain America, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: We grew up in Marvel, so we understand why it means so much over here to us.
[SPEAKER_03]: So supreme powers is within you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we understand that these characters show us different things that we can have within ourselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: So brother, what's your power, man?
[SPEAKER_03]: What gets you through?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the will that keeps Kelvin going?
[SPEAKER_03]: What makes you, brother?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the thing that everyone asks you to help them with?
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe, maybe we don't really know at the moment, or maybe you can't think of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Listen, I have to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the end of my hour that I have dedicated to help you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be back tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tomorrow, we're going to talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: how to pick your audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yesterday we talked about how to do your, how to get your voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today we talked about your, what is your superpower?
[SPEAKER_00]: And tomorrow we're gonna talk about how to choose an audience, or at least target, you know, because you can't aim at every direction at all times.
[SPEAKER_00]: You gotta aim at a specific place.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna talk about how to aim all of your efforts towards one thing together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Reg, why don't you give us last thoughts here?
[SPEAKER_03]: Amen.
[SPEAKER_03]: As the end of the day, after all chaos, what Jerry always say, he gave you wise words and he says, take care of yourself and each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: Be here tomorrow, Andy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool, love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk to you then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mullet, what's your last words for today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Still there, Mullet?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here's what we're gonna close out with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: in my heart, and that is to help people start and build and create their own thing so that they can become the best version of themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the easiest, best way to do that is to create a personal brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Posting on Instagram and TikTok and X and even a blog are free, free.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to spend a lot of money to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you post your stuff in your name, and you post consistently about a topic, and you post solving a problem using your superpower for a specific group of people, guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: In 30 to 60 to 90 days, you will be an expert in that thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, to me, that's the personal brand right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the whole thing all at once.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I want each of you to build that because it will benefit you when you're trying to get your next job.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll benefit when you try to get your next client.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll benefit you when somebody looks you up and wants to, you know, take shots at you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll be like, Oh, okay, maybe not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or they will look you up and say, okay, I don't really believe this guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they find a mountain of evidence that you are who you say you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no downside to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I don't know what your dream is,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what your superpower is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what your monetization goals are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're on the startup circle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm assuming you want to make money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way to make money is to be known.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only reason people don't buy a lot of stuff from you is because not enough people know what you offer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm just here to help you along that journey.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for coming and remember
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason we do this is because you, like me, have been on our hands and knees praying to God, have our problems solved.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only way we solve our problems, somebody else out there offers to solve the problem with their superpower, the things that I can't do for me, I need other people to help me do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, pick up your torch, light it, carry it out into the dark, cold world, because the world needs you, needs entrepreneurs, and needs magic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, I'll see you tomorrow, bye.
