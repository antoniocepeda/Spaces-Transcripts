[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, good morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sales and marketing mastery.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is typically run by Justin, but I'm co-hosting today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to talk about your wins for the week.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll get a bunch of people in here in a little while.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for right now, let's talk about wins.
[SPEAKER_01]: For those of you, this is a recorded space in the Startup Circle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that, by the way, if you are listening to this now or in the future, join the Startup Circle.
[SPEAKER_01]: 6,500 people who are all with the idea that we're going to build and create businesses and make things better.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's get started.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got
[SPEAKER_01]: runo ux dev a full stack developer looks like it's uh run runo cloud hey how you doing runo run o ux dev hi how you doing are you here are you there go ahead and uh unmike and say hi
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hello, Andy.
[SPEAKER_12]: Good day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you today?
[SPEAKER_12]: Fine.
[SPEAKER_12]: How are you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm good.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I joined the chat, I think three days back and I really enjoyed the conversation and then a lot of things from the sales and marketing side of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_12]: So you guys are doing a great job.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you very much for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you're welcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Justin does most of this all the time, so that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have a question?
[SPEAKER_01]: What was your success of the week?
[SPEAKER_12]: Right now, I'm trying to build more social media platforms.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you say trying, what do you mean by trying?
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, so I've been on social media for a long time.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think I have a YouTube account, almost 10,000 subscribers.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_12]: Recently, I start up everything again, YouTube, TikTok, these accounts.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm trying to build them right now.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, I'm in the process of building them.
[SPEAKER_12]: We changed this account now, just three followers and the rest.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm just getting tips on how to go far in building them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and what is your goal for building a social media?
[SPEAKER_12]: Audience It targets means to get says at least Okay, for what are you selling something?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you selling somebody else's something?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have a product or service?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're a website developer and how are you getting clients and
[SPEAKER_12]: Right now, I do get clients usually on Upwork, but outside that, no, I don't look at clients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, do you know how to get, do you know how to actually get clients?
[SPEAKER_01]: You ask company owners or other people who have money to buy a website, or people who need a website, you ask them, do you have a website, do you need a website?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes or no?
[SPEAKER_01]: If they say yes,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they say they need one, you say, great, I can build you one for this much money.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's maybe slightly more sophisticated than that, but probably not, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the real question is, how many people have you asked?
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, up to now, I think just a few things, though.
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can ask as many people as you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no restriction on the number of people you can ask.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is not a restriction on the number of people who can say, no, go away, you're stupid, I don't want your stuff, you're an idiot, why are you talking to me?
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's no restriction on you asking the next person.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you really want a business,
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing you need to do is ask people, say, I do this thing, do you need it?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you need it, what do you need?
[SPEAKER_01]: Some part, all of it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell me what you need, I'll see if I can figure out how to help you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it, okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: Boil down sales and marketing mastery, very simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number one, ask people what they need.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number two, figure out a way to give it to them in exchange for money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's millions and billions of people in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just have to ask them, what are you looking for?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you need in something you can do?
[SPEAKER_01]: I typically go around it the other way and say, figure out what you kind of do well all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ask people if they need that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they do say, great, what do you need?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I'll do it for this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then every time you do it, you just increase your price when you do it well and they like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have three followers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you want to get 10,000 followers?
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the best way to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Follow every single person that you see on every single space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Send them a DM and say, hi, I was on the space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just wanted to say hello.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please follow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I followed you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, how you doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to every space you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Follow everyone on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll follow you back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people follow you automatically.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you follow them, they'll follow you back.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're welcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have three followers, if you only have three followers, it's because you've only followed three other people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Follow 10,000 people, you'll get 5,000 to 10,000 followers.
[SPEAKER_12]: I tried that.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're welcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see if we can get some other speakers up here today Hello Antonio, hello, Jim, William, Dreamweaver, Susan Hi Jane What's going on?
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, good morning Andy.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way, is it Jane or Janie?
[SPEAKER_10]: It's either one.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: I called you both and you've never corrected me and I'm like, come on
[SPEAKER_11]: My brothers used to call me Janie, and other people called me Jane, so I respond to both.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no problem.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not at all bothered by that.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know something?
[SPEAKER_11]: You tricked us.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're usually up at, I'm glad I found you.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're usually at 3 p.m., but anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna be there too, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I normally co-host with, I do this time slot with Justin, and I co-host for him, and then 3 o'clock Eastern, or noon California time,
[SPEAKER_11]: And I have a suggestion for if somebody wants to hook up with quality people and get followers and get traction on this app.
[SPEAKER_11]: One of the things that you can do is when you go to a space,
[SPEAKER_11]: Always check the comment section.
[SPEAKER_11]: Like everybody's posts that are appropriate, of course.
[SPEAKER_11]: There are some crazy ones, but put a like on everybody's post and some people who really resonated their post with you.
[SPEAKER_11]: Add a comment to it and start a conversation with them.
[SPEAKER_11]: I have found more followers that way.
[SPEAKER_11]: An engagement rate goes up because of it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Because not only are you helping yourself, but you're helping the person that's holding the space.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's like a double engagement rate.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's a really nice trick and it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Jane, here's a funny thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Andrew and my family always called me Andy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the funny thing is, when I got married, my wife calls me Andrew.
[SPEAKER_01]: She doesn't call me Andy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everyone in her family, so my brother and sister-in-law and my nieces and nephews and my father-in-law and mother-in-law, they all call me Andrew.
[SPEAKER_01]: My family calls me Andy, so I totally get the
[SPEAKER_01]: two different name thing.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that's funny.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_11]: My husband likes middle names.
[SPEAKER_11]: He comes from families where, I don't know, they refer to everybody by, so he calls me, my middle name is Margaret, but he calls me Ma-grit.
[SPEAKER_11]: But I actually, you know, from him, I like that name.
[SPEAKER_11]: Do I want everybody else calling me that?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, but I'm not going to call you that.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, it's such a, yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Names are a funny thing.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, and, and it's funny cause I think when you're in a family and I was the youngest, so Janie was like more, you know, playful youngest kid, but you know, like Jane is more professional.
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's like two sides to the name.
[SPEAKER_11]: So like when I'm going into a professional setting, my name is Jane.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I totally understand that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also absolutely love the idea that we all have our special little names, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I think it's, I think it's really interesting that, you know, we as humans have different ways of, of, you know, kind of like addressing each other because my, you know, my family name,
[SPEAKER_01]: My family name was moose Because I was just a big giant lug of a kid all the time and So my family name is moose and I have a brother and two sisters.
[SPEAKER_01]: They all have special names and they don't mean anything to anybody except for the family and But it's a wonderful thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what what is your win of the week?
I
[SPEAKER_01]: Jane, what's your win of the week?
[SPEAKER_11]: My win of the week is by, quite by surprise.
[SPEAKER_11]: I got a little part-time job.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's in nursing, and I'm also in school for the cyber security, which school is at nighttime.
[SPEAKER_11]: But a neighbor, a good friend of mine passed away about two years ago, and her mother lives in my neighborhood, and she's got two sisters, and one of the sisters is the caregiver now.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I got a phone call on Monday that the police were over at the house, and the caregiver wasn't there.
[SPEAKER_11]: She was wandering around the yard, and she was very upset.
[SPEAKER_11]: Could you go over there and settle things down?
[SPEAKER_11]: So I went over there as quickly as I could and got her all settled down.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then after that, I had a talk with the caregiver and her other sister.
[SPEAKER_11]: And they decided they wanted to take me on.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's a seven-day-a-week job.
[SPEAKER_11]: to come over for a few hours and watch her while the caregiver can get out and get some me time.
[SPEAKER_11]: And to believe it or not, I just came back from a big vacation.
[SPEAKER_11]: I was gone for a month.
[SPEAKER_11]: I flew to several different places.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I did some damage to my credit cards.
[SPEAKER_11]: So by the grace of God,
[SPEAKER_11]: I got this job, and I can pay off those credit cards, you know?
[SPEAKER_11]: So you know what?
[SPEAKER_11]: I always say the Lord provides.
[SPEAKER_11]: That is my win for this week.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is amazing.
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been trying to get out of nursing and get into tech, but you know what?
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll take money any way I can get it at this point.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not going to be fussy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that idea that you wanted to get out of nursing but you're really good at it so you keep getting pulled into it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me tell you a quick story.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was working overseas and I had worked for about three years on a contract in Egypt and flying around the Middle East.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I came home and I wanted to work from home.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to have
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, more family time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I went to see one of my friends and mentors and he, and I said, he goes, well, you know, Wendy, what do you want to do?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, well, you know, I don't really want to go back overseas again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to, you know, really do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to stay here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he looked right at me and he said, what if, I don't remember exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, it was something like, why are you stopping all of the opportunities
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember exactly what it was, but the bottom line was he basically questioned me and he said You know why why not?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're you're good at that people pay you to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why don't you just keep doing that and If they're paying you more to go somewhere else, and that's what you need then Why are you why are you pushing back on that opportunity and I thought oh oh I
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I immediately just resigned myself to the fact that if somebody called, I would consider it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Literally the next day I got a call and within a week I was on an airplane back overseas again.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I came home the next time after another five or six years of doing all that, and I finally said, okay, I got a break.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took a year off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which, by the way, is the reason why I say never ever retire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Never retire.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't believe in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a made-up construct by people who are just trying to get people to die and take their money, but that's a very bad take.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know most people don't agree with me, but I don't give a crap, because I've seen it too many times.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do not believe in retirement.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do not believe in taking all your money, pivoting it into a...
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going off on a tangent, so since we have a hand, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I basically came home and took a sabbatical for a year, and then when I went to re-engage, it took six more months to re-engage and get clients and get activities again, and since that point in time, I've never, ever slowed down, never stopped, never stopped marketing, never given up, never held back, consider every opportunity, ever given, ever called, I take every single phone call, I talk to every single person about everything because
[SPEAKER_01]: You never know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just absolutely disagree with the, uh, you know, I took a sabbatical.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had, I had three years worth of cash in, you know, tax free after taxes, cash in the bank.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had enough to live for three years and it still wasn't even anything close to what I really wanted or needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought I had the world by the tail and I was wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because right at that same time was exactly when the financial crisis happened and it was a bloodbath and I was on the bad side of the leverage stick and I was stupid.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no, no, no, no, look, I'm fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not the point.
[SPEAKER_01]: The point was before all this happened, I decided to go to, okay, I'm going to go back and do more consulting work here in the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it took six more months to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I finally got re-engaged.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got more clients.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got everything running again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the financial thing hit at the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was like, Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I spent all this money to do this stuff and whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was like, Oh man, now I'm, I'm not going to do this anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm on the backside of all this and I've you know, you had to struggle that you know, I got back up it man Yeah, it's like oh you're down Oh, then it starts to rain and then they splash the water on you and then somebody steps on your face in the mud and then when you get up they trip you so you from now you're muddy on your back and Then they laugh at you and you slip and fall when you try to get off the street.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of what it was like But I'm not complaining.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just saying that's what happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the whole point of that stupid long story.
[SPEAKER_01]: The point is, if you do something well and people give you money in exchange for that value, find a way to keep doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm not trying to be...
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not really that smart.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might be good at like a 360 degree view of me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm good at two or three things, two or three little points of the 360.
[SPEAKER_01]: The rest of it, I'm average or I'm below average in every way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting, but yeah, congratulations on your new job and do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see Jim jumped up Jim Hey, what's going on today?
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy Friday, Jim.
[SPEAKER_11]: Can I throw something in?
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, yeah, please Yeah, I absolutely agree with the retirement thing.
[SPEAKER_11]: I I was retired for two years here and That you know what?
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a one-way street to dimension death.
[SPEAKER_11]: You got to keep on moving forward.
[SPEAKER_11]: I
[SPEAKER_11]: keep on learning, keep your brain active.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the only way and you'll have a quality life up till the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: What happened to me was, I came home, I had a lot of money, I had enough money to just not work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was, I at the time, I thought that not now looking back, I was really stupid.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know what, looking now, if I literally would have just put it into any type of
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, uh, growth fund or just any, if I would have just put it in the S and P 500, I could have lived.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would have never, ever, ever had to work again on anything for anybody, not even clients.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would have only had to do stuff I decided to do, but you know what you, you gotta, there's a really interesting book I read about,
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people have to get rich twice.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get rich once, they buy a bunch of stuff, they think it's going to go on forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Business is cyclical like the waves.
[SPEAKER_01]: When the wave goes back out again, they get stuck on the shore with all the crap.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it either survives or it crushes them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they figure out how to get back in the waves.
[SPEAKER_01]: They ride the wave again.
[SPEAKER_01]: When they get back on shore, yeah, then they're fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it usually takes a couple attempts at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's go to Jim.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, Jim.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_09]: Hold on a second.
[SPEAKER_09]: I got to put in my mic.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, no, I can hear you.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're good.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, can you?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Were we talking about something specific?
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't want to take you off track, Andy.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care.
[SPEAKER_01]: Listen, this is the sales and marketing mastering hour with Justin, but he's not here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm co-hosting, so we could go wherever you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where's Justin?
[SPEAKER_01]: He's actually taking some family time for a couple of days.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know what you were talking about before, but I just wanted to comment on the whole retirement thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it depends on your personality personally.
[SPEAKER_09]: I like to keep engaged, but
[SPEAKER_09]: My dad's been retired for like 30 years, like 90, and he's been just reading the newspaper every day for 30 years.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_09]: Honestly, to me, I'm like, aren't you bored?
[SPEAKER_09]: He's like, why am I bored?
[SPEAKER_09]: I have the newspaper every day.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm like, okay, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: What what happened what happened to me was I worked on all these big projects I got this crazy thing overseas I came back home and I I took in my mind a sabbatical not a retirement but a sabbatical and at the same time some of the Older guys that I had been working with before they retired quote-unquote retired, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They were working at the state.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're working this Fed agency blah blah blah they working for this telecom and they all retired and
[SPEAKER_01]: In that year, a bunch of guys died.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they retired, six, eight, nine, 10 months later, they're dead.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I did some research on, and by the way, this was 25 years ago, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I did the research, it is a unbelievably shocking number of people who, they reach retirement age, they take their pension, and within two years, they're gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is really, really shocking.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I've seen those studies as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think a lot of it depends on, I think, your temperament and your predisposition as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know how they would measure that, but I have an uncle as well who's similar to my dad.
[SPEAKER_09]: And as far as I could tell, if I lived their life, I would be, like, bored senseless.
[SPEAKER_09]: And my wife even says, like, what does your dad do all day?
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_09]: He tells me he reads the newspaper.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what he does all day.
[SPEAKER_09]: I really don't.
[SPEAKER_09]: So he doesn't golf, doesn't do anything, doesn't travel.
[SPEAKER_09]: He traveled when my mom was alive.
[SPEAKER_09]: But after my mom passed, he pretty much like for the last, I don't know, whatever, he's just goes to the library, you know, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't understand it myself, so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, listen, I appreciate the perspective that people can retire and live their life and enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I 100% support that, agree with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for me, nope.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I think you need to be self-aware about what drives you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, are you a husky or are you like, you know, like a hamster?
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, what are you?
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, you need to know who you are, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a moose.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was my nickname.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said that earlier when I was, when I was a kid, just because most people don't realize how big moose are.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, they're huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two to 3,000 pounds, they are eight to 10 feet tall, plus antlers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're massive.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, you die because the body is on these stilts, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: And then when you hit them, you take the legs out and the body falls on the... Yeah, it's like getting run over by a car.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And anyway, so I've told everyone, I'm a big guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was six foot tall when I was 12 years old.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I was 12, I was six foot tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody thought,
[SPEAKER_01]: the hell are you feeding this giant moose so my nickname growing up was moose oh interesting i didn't know that just and i you know i'm i'm like 62 250 if you you think about
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the size of a middle linebacker or a tight end.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now today they're a little taller, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're maybe 6'4".
[SPEAKER_01]: But you stand a 6'4 guy next to me and you're like, where's his hair?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not a lot of difference, but anyway.
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you like Justin, like you kind of keep active and stuff?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's some pictures of Justin and I.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I keep active.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you still swim?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't swim every day anymore, but I do work out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also don't get to train in martial arts anymore because of some other issues, but I still do squats and push-ups and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason I do that is because you can do squats and push-ups everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't require anything except for you to decide, OK, got to knock out the 100.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, martial arts is definitely harder as you get older.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I won't take up too much time here.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, Neda's got her hand up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go to Neda.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, Jim.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, Jane.
[SPEAKER_06]: A few wins for me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow, a lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: Number one, I am almost done tackling my fear of entrepreneurship with a lot of kindness from people, especially the people in the startup circle and especially your spaces.
[SPEAKER_06]: And my career coach, I announced last night that I'll be teaching a 90-minute masterclass on how to cope
[SPEAKER_06]: Event so, um how to be magnetic on social audio rooms, but also in um live streams And uh, i've set the date for november 23rd i'm intentionally doing this like announcing because I Even now i'm still trying to get used to promoting myself um And i'll be honest it feels a little bit strange
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, but the fees and everything will be shared.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's gonna be on november 23rd.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a sunday.
[SPEAKER_06]: So Still trying to figure out the time, uh the promotional stuff promotional flyers and everything, but but i'm dab like i'm getting used to talking about it and It's uncomfortable, but i'm doing it anyway, so Yeah You have to have fear in order for you to have courage
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's no fear, there's no courage.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no fear of you just taking the mic and talking to me, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's not the only thing I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just to be less scared, I'm hosting spaces and events online for founders.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you don't mind, I can drop it in the comments.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: on Sunday called Builder Files.
[SPEAKER_06]: This one's really for founders and entrepreneurs.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're trying to get more people who are a little bit more established in their careers.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be on Chatmoza.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if anyone in the link to register is in the post, like the comments of the actual post, you can log in from your Facebook, your TikTok, I believe, LinkedIn, X, of course, and you could even turn on your video during the event.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's gonna be at 3 p.m. EST.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm really excited for that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm experimenting.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm experimenting that platform for now to see what it's like.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if it's good, I'll host there.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_06]: But a lot of exciting stuff happening with Web3 as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm just getting used to being comfortable, uncomfortable all over again.
[SPEAKER_06]: And entrepreneurship is something I've been very, very scared of for the past few years.
[SPEAKER_06]: But like your spaces and
[SPEAKER_06]: Tim's TikToks, actually, believe it or not, and Justin's, and Timo has been very helpful, like, thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: You all have been a huge source of help, including Jessica, and... Community is where it's at, so if anyone has any fears, check it with the community, because we'll be there to support you and give you a kick in the butt when your fears take over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you're welcome, of course always except I I do I want to point something out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course Okay When you're when you're hosting the hunt or any of these other things you always feel like you're in control and you have a very Specific type of demeanor that you present when you're talking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, this is observation.
I
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you're talking to me like right now, you're not using that same demeanor.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I, my question is, what makes you think there's a difference between when you're hosting the hunt and you're telling people, okay, hold on, you just stay over there for a second and we're going to be right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to go here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, let's go to this person.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, let's go here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why is it that that is so, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: Easy obvious and clear and yet when you're talking about this stuff, it seems It's not as obvious or clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you thought about that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, and I have a response because as a host a host has to be able to fill in the blanks from time to time and
[SPEAKER_06]: You're not always going to have someone who comes up and talks.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have two answers.
[SPEAKER_06]: One, I'm not 100%.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think I'll be 100% comfortable with anything, but I have some level of comfort when it comes to the job search process because I've done a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I have knowledge to share, but entrepreneurship
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of a lot of times winging it, but I'm also like doing things on the fly And I'm noticing that I need to leverage from the experience that I currently have to give people advice, but I'm also Getting right there right there, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know the answer.
[SPEAKER_06]: I
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to go back and listen to the recording 31 minutes in, okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's what happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: You said, oh, when I do this, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clear, concise, direct, thoughtful, expressive, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you got to the word entrepreneurism, you hesitated, pulled back, tried to find the words, tried to think of what to say, and then said it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my point is, if that word is causing you a problem, throw it in the garbage and just keep
[SPEAKER_01]: doing your thing, you're gonna do hosting, you're gonna do event management, awesome, you'll be fantastic at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk about everything like you're the host filling the gap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because when you got right to those words, all of a sudden you're, the sound, the presence, the projection, everything just kinda stuttered.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go back and listen to the court recording Thanks, that's just that that is just your mind because like right now, okay, you're back That's how you should talk all the time about everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you don't know just go, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm working on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't know Practice that look.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it will it will it will help go listen go back and listen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay Let's go to Patricia

[SPEAKER_07]: So she's She's part of holding me accountable to this
[SPEAKER_07]: I, um, put one of my projects out in the wild.
[SPEAKER_07]: And after I install some affiliate links that I just got approved for this morning, I am hands off for 90 days.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I'll do, I'll do whatever work comes through it, but not letting myself tinker or change anything like that, but actually having a site out in the wild, fully functional.
[SPEAKER_07]: that I am not tinkering with is a huge thing for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to put it in the purple pill.
[SPEAKER_07]: I will.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everyone can see it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll go ahead and put that in there, if I can.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is this.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is basically my branded landing page that Christelle and I did a workshop on.
[SPEAKER_07]: She prefers Lovable.
[SPEAKER_07]: I prefer WordPress.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I created mine over on WordPress.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, um, you know, the journal is still not there, but that's because I don't have topics that I want to talk about just yet that don't have a home elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_07]: When I do have a topic that I want to talk about that doesn't have a home on my other platforms, that's when something will show up in the journal.
[SPEAKER_07]: Otherwise it is now down in the purple pill or in my case because I'm on the computer Okay, well that's awesome, but yeah, I'm excited that's done and then later today I am rescheduling a call and I am Also making sure that my future podcast Site is all set up as well so I have a lot planned for this coming week, but I
[SPEAKER_07]: Just having this out in the wild is like a major major major win for me Awesome, that's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you put your put it down in the purple pill Everybody when you see it ghost go to patricia's site click on all the stuff go in look at all of her things click on all the stuff That's the way to do it If you like something buy it Yep

[SPEAKER_07]: I have ever written with they're not as nice as your fountain pen Andy But they're the most comfortable pins.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've ever written with my family fights over them nice They come in they come in a pack of eight and
[SPEAKER_07]: and I've had to order it told me when I went to the site to grab the link for them that I've ordered them four times this year and that's because my family and I fight over them and we end up you know keeping more than we should in our secret spot right so yeah it's
[SPEAKER_07]: I love them.

[SPEAKER_01]: All right, let's go to Fitz.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, what's going on, Fitz?
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, Andy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for the opportunity to speak here.
[SPEAKER_08]: For those of you who may not know me, I am Michael Fitzgerald, a.k.a.
[SPEAKER_08]: Fitz.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm the CEO of the Biz Dev Club.
[SPEAKER_08]: Check out the link in my profile if you want to know more.
[SPEAKER_08]: Last week was Seattle AI week.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was quite busy attending lots of events.
[SPEAKER_08]: I also hosted an event myself.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was entitled biz dev AI and you what does it all mean?
[SPEAKER_08]: I interviewed a woman named Melissa Reeves.
[SPEAKER_08]: She's the CEO of StoryFruition.
[SPEAKER_08]: She, during the event, demoed one of her new AI products called Missy AI.
[SPEAKER_08]: She helps people tell better stories, mainly in business.
[SPEAKER_08]: And her product, Missy AI, allows for
[SPEAKER_08]: want to interact with her knowledge and her expertise because if you try and get her by herself she charges a lot more than 10 bucks a month which is how much the Missy AI product is.
[SPEAKER_08]: I interviewed another guy he's a lawyer
[SPEAKER_08]: He talked about intellectual property and business development and AI and the intersection of all those things.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I hosted a panel, a speaker panel of four business development SMEs.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we went for about an hour and we could have probably kept going.
[SPEAKER_08]: But in the interest of time, I was kind of like, well, we're kind of at
[SPEAKER_08]: the end of what I scheduled for this event.
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel like we should kind of wrap up somehow.
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, all in all, it was an amazing, amazing event.
[SPEAKER_08]: About 55 people showed up.
[SPEAKER_08]: I had about just over 100 people registered for a free event.
[SPEAKER_08]: I threw in a couple of sponsors.
[SPEAKER_08]: One guy from Silicon Valley Bank, he paid for the pizzas.
[SPEAKER_08]: And another guy, a friend of mine, he provided the venue at a very, very discounted rate.
[SPEAKER_08]: His name is Jonathan Blanco.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's a good friend of mine here in the Seattle area.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's the CEO of Nift Mint, which does real-world asset tokenization for e-commerce.
[SPEAKER_08]: And yeah, so that was, yes, last week was a good week, I think.
[SPEAKER_08]: Perhaps even the next week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that sounds great.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I threw some more stuff in the purple pill if you want to see some photos or a post that I made following up with that event.
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, please, if you're listening to this and you haven't already reached out to me or know me or interact with me, please do.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd be happy to talk more about it or learn more about what you're doing, whatever.
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, thanks, Andy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Fitz.
[SPEAKER_01]: What a great week.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Feel free to come back all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We love hearing all of your successes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go to Dream Nerd.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, Dream Nerd.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm good.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you today?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing awesome, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as for the wins for the week, which is just about the question that I had from you, I am an artist developer, which creates artworks and created a tool as well for creating artworks that Vivex Company's motion
[SPEAKER_02]: design hosts and some big names in art market are using that tool set and i'm selling that tool set as well on gumroad and would like to know that about the success i should say that i had a client this week for the tool they they took the tool and immediately said that oh i found another alternate for your tool which
[SPEAKER_02]: seems to be working and promising to me and i want a full refund because i didn't activate the tool yet and i said yes of course i will pay back you 100% but let me also pay you a three days license of my tool so you can check and compare my toolset with the alternates that you are talking about
[SPEAKER_02]: And after three days, he came back and pre-casted again the tool set, which was a big win for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know right now at least that if someone can have a room to compare my tool set with the available options for themselves, they will definitely, or at least in most of cases, definitely choose the development that I've done over the others.
[SPEAKER_02]: About the question, the point is that when I sent over the three days demo, my tool set using a specific type of not like licensing.
[SPEAKER_02]: that is applied to several key points of my toolset.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if I send them, they will be able to use lots of parts of the toolset forever for free.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other parts are subscription models, $100 per month and does not authorize subscribe, but they should pay if they want the main
[SPEAKER_02]: aspects of that tool but there are lots of aspects of that tool that are really handy and if I send this over with three day free license they will have access for free to the other parts of the tool set.
[SPEAKER_01]: What does the tool set do?
[SPEAKER_02]: The tool set is the unique solution and one-on-one solution over...
[SPEAKER_02]: Unique?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no...
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, listen.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is no appliance to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: What does it do?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I... Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It creates three gross animations specifically.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also can do VFX tasks like creating Venom symbiote if you have seen the Venom movie.
[SPEAKER_02]: uh they had done a four months development to creating a creature that can have that type of reaction with the environment but using my tool set i created a tutorial and proved in my youtube channel that you can do this with my development called grow infinite in just two hours well oh cool uh okay so you do uh
[SPEAKER_01]: animations inside videos or live animations with environmental awareness?
[SPEAKER_02]: I do 3D animation and procedural animation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also I do tool development for creating animations that it is not possible without that development.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so generative design Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first you should totally put that information in the purple pill so everybody can see it and however, you want to do that second thing is I Love the wind, but do you have a question?
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to see that, do you think sending over the three days license for everyone without any, you know, without any steps, they can just come to my Gumroad and buy the three day license and will have to access to many aspects of the tool without any payment?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: For, for, let me, let me, okay, here, here's the first thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: When,
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're talking on spaces and you want to say something great, ask one thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: and then let the host or the panel respond.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you ask a multiple-step question, you'll end up with me, because I'm a simple guy, and I'll say, what's your question?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got your question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got your question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the way I think you should think about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason drug dealers give out free samples is to get people hooked on their drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not giving them a three-day license for free.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're giving them access to the tool for free.
[SPEAKER_01]: and you're not letting them buy it for free, you're just giving it to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Marketing is language.
[SPEAKER_01]: Change the way you're saying it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just tell people, I've got this really cool thing, you can try it for free over here, click the link.
[SPEAKER_01]: The link goes to your Gumroad and says click here, zero cost, click the button, put in your email, done.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get their email address, you get their
[SPEAKER_01]: They get access to the tool.
[SPEAKER_01]: After three days, license expires.
[SPEAKER_01]: You send a follow-up that says, if you like it, click here to keep going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Simple, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But you need to change the way you're describing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're giving a free sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're giving a free thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're giving them access to a million-dollar tool for three days for no cost, however you want to describe it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Saying it's a three-day license for free is not going to win any any awards.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one's gonna want to buy that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay Did that help?
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much, uh, yes i'm almost inspired with most of your spaces.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you Thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Appreciate you coming if um, you can always reach out to justin or myself anytime if you have any questions, uh in dms We'll be happy to help you there
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go to Asher and then T. There was someone else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I see him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go to Asher.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, Asher.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it Asher?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, Andy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we introducing our companies?
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone was introducing their companies, so I wanted to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we typically do is it's wins for the week, and then if you have a sales or marketing question, you can ask and we'll fill it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you want to give an introduction,
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 seconds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, like, yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm actually I created an advanced artificial intelligence.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, we launched it May 20, May 20, 2025, but we started working on it in late September.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's been less than a month since we publicly launched and we already made $300, $330.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Congratulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that your, is that your win for the week?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or did you have that and a question?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that was my win for the week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Andy, what about you?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your win for the week?
[SPEAKER_08]: If I may, Andy, I'd like to color a little bit of this guy, Asher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead, Fitz.
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, this guy, Asher, wandered into one of my spaces a few days ago and started talking about AI.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was like, who is this guy?
[SPEAKER_08]: and Asher has been Kind of making the rounds starting to make the rounds on on x-spaces.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I wouldn't be surprised if he followed me in here but however, you got here he's here and He's a pretty good AI guy and Yeah, he's doing some interesting stuff Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you fits.
I
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Andy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Andy, what's your wins for the week?
[SPEAKER_01]: My wins?
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to join at the beginning of the space to get all those.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't actually give any.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just messing with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am totally messing with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: My wins for the week are I reassigned
[SPEAKER_01]: squeezed down a number of extra expenses that I didn't, uh, that I was using in the past, but don't use anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that freed up some additional capital so that I can move, um, some other things around and put things in place.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was my big win for the week was moving, uh, looking at my expenses and squeezing stuff down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was my big win for the week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go to T. Hello T. Oh, hi.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, hi, Andy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I've got a humorous inverted win for the week.
[SPEAKER_05]: I spent the last three years developing and writing some software, which I officially scrapped this week, because I finally realized that it was a high tech solution for a low tech problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: It took me three years to work that one out.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was my inverse win for the week.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what was it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was called the Septic Tank Management System, where if you live in a rural
[SPEAKER_05]: community such as I do, you never know if your septic tank has been emptied or not.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I wrote this elaborate system, sending emails, SMSs, the whole nine yards, bookings, maps, the whole lot, presented it to the municipality and they looked at me like I was crazy and they said, well, all our guys do is they just drive to the house, suck out the tank and that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I understand I grew up on a farm and we had a septic tank and when the toilets stopped flushing We had to have the truck come out and you know empty it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I didn't know what
[SPEAKER_01]: That has a very unique smell when you're emptying septic tanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I mean, you live in a farm, there's animals everywhere, there's compost piles everywhere, and then there's sucking the yuck out of a septic tank.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a whole different smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ooh, I know exactly what you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just calling them up and saying, come out and take care of it, that's all you needed, huh?
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, all I can say, Andy, is they grow them big on the farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they do.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead, T. Yeah, so that was the full extent of my heartache
[SPEAKER_01]: Solution for a low-tech problem, which is perfectly consistent with the type of person that I am So there was no real surprises there Yeah, amazing, I mean sometimes don't we all do that right we overcomplicate The We overcomplicate things especially if you You know the old story about
[SPEAKER_01]: you're an expert with a hammer everything is a nail so oh my goodness okay all right we've got this go ahead dream go ahead dream nerd I just put it in the comments the stuff that I've developed it so everyone can see and check it
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I saw that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I liked it and I reposted it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, what you need to do is follow up with a link that says click here to get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The link is in the first comment to see my YouTube channel, to see what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if they like it, there's also a link to buy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me help you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, don't make people do three clicks when they can do one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, you've got a beautiful animation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right there you've got another link, but it goes to YouTube, which makes me then go to another thing, which then makes me look in the comments to find it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why don't you just post it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Click here to buy this right there in your comments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just make it as easy for everyone as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: if you notice on a converting landing page what happens it says here's the cool thing click here to find more and it either jumps you to the actual page or it takes you right to the checkout usually it jumps you to the bottom where you can click the checkout page so that they don't go checkout and abandon that's the reason why but if you just scroll down it goes click here then there's a button that says click here then another one that says here it's embedded in the text i mean it's
[SPEAKER_01]: Click here to buy button is on that landing page, seven, eight, nine, 10 times sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make it easy, obvious, clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make it, if you have to think or take an extra step, every time somebody thinks, they're not gonna do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every time somebody takes the extra step, they're not gonna do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So give it to them as quickly and as fast and as easy as possible, in every possible way, always.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll give you an example.
[SPEAKER_01]: I write lots of reports.
[SPEAKER_01]: I create lots of reports every week and they go into these beautiful systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of the people who get the reports, every time I post the report, they get an email that says there's a new report on this set of the budget or this set of the project or this whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I do?
[SPEAKER_01]: I copy and paste the text and put it into an email.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I take a screenshot of the little graphs and I put it in an email and I send it to the same people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my emails get opened and the automatic ones get tossed or just archived.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason is because they can look at my email without opening it up and go, we're all green, we're good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Archive it they know the answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I give them the answer every time instead of making them go fishing digging and try listen Anyone who works in management or leadership anyone?
[SPEAKER_01]: No matter where you are when you start no matter how you got there when you get there The demand on the energy that you have is not on looking at your report that's like a gauge in the car and
[SPEAKER_01]: You glance, everything's fine, you keep going.
[SPEAKER_01]: If one of them turns red, all your attention goes to the red one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what you want to do when you help your clients is give them something that they can just go, this works always, click the button, boom, it always.
[SPEAKER_01]: One button, no instructions, turn it on, it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: How to buy it, one button, no instructions, click here, buy, put your credit card in, hit enter, done, send it to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Start working right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: No elaborate onboarding, no elaborate, remove every single possible step you can so you can get people to answer as fast as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go to T, what's going on?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I agree with 100% of what you just said.
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of the laws of sales is very simple.
[SPEAKER_05]: Make it easy for people to do business with you.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a cardinal rule, which basically fits in behind what you've just said.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's brilliant.
[SPEAKER_05]: Make it easy for people to do business with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every step that you make somebody jump, every hoop you make them jump through,
[SPEAKER_01]: is eventually they stop.
[SPEAKER_01]: We used to do these surveys at work, or for my clients, or for their customers, and when we did the surveys, they would say, okay, we're gonna put in these, and it's like 50 questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, you're gonna get 90% abandon rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Three or four questions, that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hit the big rocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you like it, yes or no?
[SPEAKER_01]: Could we do better, yes or no?
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell us what we could do better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you like it?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell us what we can do better.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Survey.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really appreciate being here.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing is, and I'm going to talk about this later today, where you might ask me anything later today in a few hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: In four hours, I'll do my space at that noon lunchtime, Pacific Coast, 12 o'clock, 3 o'clock Eastern time, time zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you frame a question and then you ask for a response, they will 100% of the time give you an answer based on the frame you've provided.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want the truth, never ask framing questions and never ask yes-no questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ask a question that makes them answer with some other detail.
[SPEAKER_01]: and then follow up with a question and then encourage whatever their answer was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two questions and a follow-up.
[SPEAKER_01]: That works.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you frame the question, they will use the frame to answer the question every time.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this current economy,
[SPEAKER_01]: With the stock market the way it is, and the current shutdown of the United States government, can you tell me the outlook for the next five years?
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, they're going to filter everything through the first two things you said.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's obvious when I say it like that, but it's not obvious when we go, you know, man, I'm really thirsty.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you want to eat today?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds like it's innocent, but it really means let's go get something to drink right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And wherever we go, better have drinks immediately, right now, before we start eating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, let's go to Jane and then T for some last thoughts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we'll close up for the space for today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll come back on Monday for the Sales and Marketing Mastery.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, this was really an inspiring space.
[SPEAKER_11]: I really appreciated everything that was shared here.
[SPEAKER_11]: And Nada,
[SPEAKER_11]: You are a natural-born leader.
[SPEAKER_11]: You have leadership when you host spaces, and I really love your style.
[SPEAKER_11]: So keep on believing in yourself, because I think you got what it takes to do what you are wanting to do.
[SPEAKER_11]: And everybody, just keep on going forward.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, faith without works is dead.
[SPEAKER_11]: You got to do the footwork, and that's the bottom line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Jane.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go to T for some of that out-in-the-country wisdom.
[SPEAKER_05]: Out-in-the-country wisdom.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, this actually happened in the city.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was parking my car in a parkade and this unfortunate woman walked up to me and she said, can I wash your car?
[SPEAKER_05]: And my immediate response was,
[SPEAKER_05]: No, thanks.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm fine.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm in a hurry.
[SPEAKER_05]: But as you were saying, it all depends upon how you frame your question.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I said to the next person that you go to say, how would you like to come back to a nice, shiny, smart looking car?
[SPEAKER_05]: And when I came back to fetch my car, she had so many cars to wash because she didn't ask a say no question.
[SPEAKER_05]: Her question elicited a yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that's the most important thing about asking questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, don't ask a question you don't know the answer to because you'll get caught out every time.
[SPEAKER_05]: But
[SPEAKER_05]: always ask a question where the probability is that they'll answer with a yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And three yeses means a deal.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's what I have to say.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks T. Appreciate you this Anthony and Really appreciate you Netta.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for coming Jamie dream nerd General will get to you on Monday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come back again Thanks for all the speakers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got to go now And Justin's got these four questions that he asked at the end of his life But that's Justin's thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm just gonna ask you to
[SPEAKER_01]: Pick up your torch, carry it out into the darkness, because the world's a cold and dark place, and it needs us entrepreneurs.
[SPEAKER_01]: The world needs what you have to offer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So please be willing to share.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a wonderful day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll be back in four hours-ish.
[SPEAKER_01]: And talk to you then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye.
