[SPEAKER_04]: All right, good afternoon.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's noon on Thursday, October 30, the day before Halloween.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we are going to talk about high leverage skills in your personal brand, specifically things like sharpen your observations, fix your communication, lock in execution without waste, and do things like sharpen your observations to read the room.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got all kinds of interesting, interesting things to talk about.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'll get some other folks up here as everybody starts to join.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, what's going on, Wealthy?
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for joining.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kyle, how you doing?
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, Andy, I'm doing well.
[SPEAKER_06]: You might remember me from the last space.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, how's it going?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good, what's up?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's raining pretty hard here in New Jersey, so I just got home safe and now I'm about to listen in and knock off some work for the rest of the day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's 74 degrees here out in Northern California, so sunny.
[SPEAKER_04]: No rain, but I love the rain.
[SPEAKER_04]: I worked in Cairo, Egypt for a couple of years, and while I was there, it rained, I think, for every day that I was there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it rained five, between three and five times total.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember exactly, but not very many and a pretty, pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, I love the rain.
[SPEAKER_04]: Both my kids were born on days it rained.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a, I love the rain.
[SPEAKER_04]: So enjoy the, enjoy the rain.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Rainy days are definitely those days to just try to stay in and look out the window and just do some deep work.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's, that's at least the effect it has on me when it's sunny.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's also motivating to work and the sun's coming in, but then I'm like, I might just go for a walk right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the rain definitely helps on those days, for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So do you have a question about high leverage skills or personal brand?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or are you just checking in?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, while I'm here, I always have questions around personal brand and high leverage skills.
[SPEAKER_06]: I always want to better myself and grow and stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: And from my understanding, this just started right now, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: I think me and you were the first couple of people in here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so I don't know how these typically run.
[SPEAKER_06]: I usually pop in towards mid-conversation, so if I'm just thinking... Well, ask away.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just ask away.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have a question, normally what happens is for the first four or five minutes, I basically give an outline of what's happening.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you listen to any of the recordings, you'll see that I usually describe my ideas about whatever's happening that day, and it does two purposes.
[SPEAKER_04]: First,
[SPEAKER_04]: It gives a framework for the rest of the conversation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And secondly, it gives people time to click the buttons and connect.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, there's not, you know, it's hard to get started immediately.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not like everybody's sitting and waiting and then I turn it on and, you know, the curtain goes up and everyone's ready.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_04]: I turn the curtain, I turn the, I turn the mic on and then people kind of show up eventually.
[SPEAKER_06]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is actually something that I had in an earlier space from maybe about an hour ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: which was a whole bunch of AI tech folks and stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: But what we're talking about is, you know, building a business or building, in this case, a personal brand while working at a company and trying to find the balance of separating who you are personally versus your professional profile.
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially, you know, I mean, really, I think this applies for everyone, but I
[SPEAKER_06]: as an employee of X have a separate X handle than what my personal one is.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I kind of manage both and actually have been neglecting my personal one.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, um, yeah, so my question is, I guess, like, how do you balance what's the best way or what are people's thoughts on balancing your personal brand and to what extent do you build it?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I know it's definitely beneficial as far as posting around, you know, if I'm posting around X content or,
[SPEAKER_06]: how to get the most out of ads or whatever the case is, that's definitely going to help with social proof and lead generation and stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: But also, anything that's outside of X or the companies that you guys work for, how comfortable or how much are you promoting maybe a side hustle?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, hey, I have this business where I'm actually making money on the side, because my thoughts behind it are,
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wouldn't wanna get laid off from a company if they know I got something else that's going on that they know is potentially, or in their eyes, taking time away from investing it fully into the business.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so you asked a whole bunch of questions there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I did, sorry, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's okay, but here's, so for a personal brand, here's my advice.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll give you advice first, and I'll answer the question second.
[SPEAKER_04]: My advice is,
[SPEAKER_04]: Think about your questions first.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ask one question and wait for the answer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Second thing, if you want to do a setup, describe the situation, but give people a clue.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, I'm going to describe something, and then I want you to give me your opinion on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the question.
[SPEAKER_04]: One thing, one thought, one question at a time.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you can do that,
[SPEAKER_04]: you will you will amplify yourself in the in the eyes of everybody else.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Second, second thing specifically, you asked three times, well, how do you separate or how do you manage the difference between full time employee and your own personal brand?
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's my advice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Number one, you need a personal brand more than you need anything else in today's world.
[SPEAKER_04]: because Amazon just laid off 12,000 people, Google just laid off people, Meta made off people, Chase Bank, GM just deleted their entire AI automation division.
[SPEAKER_04]: You need a personal brand 100%.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, how do you, okay, so yes, you need one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because when you get laid off, when the company changes, when you quit, when you leave and go somewhere else, you have to take some amount of credibility with you.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the past, that was a reference.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the reference was simply they assumed HR or a title, and they give you a good reference that HR and title gave enough credibility for them to believe whatever you're saying.
[SPEAKER_04]: Today, that's not enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the reason it's not enough is because
[SPEAKER_04]: Very simply, HR departments restrict people from giving references.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just bottom line, you can't get a good reference.
[SPEAKER_04]: All you can get is, yes, they worked here from this date to this date.
[SPEAKER_04]: You go, well, can you recommend them?
[SPEAKER_04]: You just go, they worked here from this date to this date.
[SPEAKER_04]: The larger the organization, the less reference you're gonna get, okay?
[SPEAKER_04]: Third thing, how much do you do between the two?
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's what I suggest.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can take this however you want.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is what I actually do.
[SPEAKER_04]: 80% me, targeted to my audience, targeted about my superpower, the things that I do well.
[SPEAKER_04]: 10% of my content is the strange, unique things that make me me and not anybody else, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: I love music, I'm a musician, I play lots of instruments, I went to school on a scholarship, I have produced music, I have albums, I've done all kinds of cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that, but that's not what I focus on.
[SPEAKER_04]: And 10%,
[SPEAKER_04]: brand ambassador for whatever company you work for, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So Kyle, if you, you know, be 80%, this is my recommendation, 80% Kyle, 10% Kyle's unique, unbelievable, different, that nobody knows about, and 10%, by the way, I work as an engineer, I work as a customer service, I work for X, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my recommendation.
[SPEAKER_06]: Got it, thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so you got all three, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: I do, thanks so much, that was super helpful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Be more consistent in your communication, simpler, more direct.
[SPEAKER_04]: Number two, tell people about what you're gonna do, how you're gonna do it, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Second, you need a personal brand, 100%.
[SPEAKER_04]: There is no downside to a personal brand unless you're a billionaire or super famous.
[SPEAKER_04]: There is zero downside, zero, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Third, 80, 10, 10.
[SPEAKER_04]: 80% targeted, specific, niche-focused, down to a group of 10,000 people, okay?
[SPEAKER_04]: And let me give you the logic and the research behind a niche of 10,000 people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's why.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you talk to 100 people a day for 100 days, and your average engagement rate, meaning they're just going to hear you, is 3%.
[SPEAKER_04]: average sale rate is somewhere around that same thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: You only need 10,000 people because you're only gonna talk to each one of them three times in a year.
[SPEAKER_04]: Three.
[SPEAKER_04]: Three times.
[SPEAKER_04]: They may find your content differently, but you're gonna actively reach out to 100 people a day for 100 days, and then you're gonna cycle that same 100.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're gonna get 10,000 people.
[SPEAKER_04]: 100 times 100 is 10,000, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you get the 10,000 people
[SPEAKER_04]: who are your targeted niche, you just keep going round and round and round on them until you get your number of clients that you need.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're selling a $500 product, pick the number you want to make per month.
[SPEAKER_04]: Normally people pick like 5,000, 10,000, 20,000 a month, whatever number they pick, just back into it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You sell a $500 product, you need 1,000 people to buy a $500 product to make
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, my math's not great right this second.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me do that again.
[SPEAKER_04]: To make $10,000, you sell 500 products, you need 200 people to buy $500 worth of products for you to make $10,000 a month.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do that, and just pick something, deliver it, something that you know, and do it over and over and over and over and over again
[SPEAKER_04]: until you get there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you have an audience, you have a list of 100,000 people, and you talk to, and you reach out to, actively reach out to 100 people a day, it'd take you almost 10 years to get through 100,000 people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just find a niche of 10,000 people or less.
[SPEAKER_04]: Talk to 100 people a day.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you reach out to a hundred people a day of leads in even the general area, you're going to get clients and it's going to be successful.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's why I say niche down.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean Hermosi says it, Gary Vee says it, Grant Cardone says it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dolph Daru's Chris Paul everybody says niche down find a narrow niche of audience, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: We had So
[SPEAKER_04]: If you read Alex, by the way, I love Alex Ramosi's books because they're clear, they talk to me, okay?
[SPEAKER_04]: So when you're reading Alex Ramosi's books about his $100 million leads, okay?
[SPEAKER_04]: $100 million leads machine is find a group of 10,000 people and talk to them 100 at a time until you get your clients.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you do that for 100 days, you're gonna get your clients.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you get your clients, now you have a business.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just do more.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now you have some income so you can put that again, you know, just on and on and on.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the point is, pick a small niche, not all of the males in North America.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: Alex Ramosi said he could have sold to anybody, but he chose a very narrow niche.
[SPEAKER_04]: Gym owners with a lease and one employee.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they had to have a company and they had to have a lease of a building
[SPEAKER_04]: and they had to have an employee, and then he would like, okay, that's my target.
[SPEAKER_04]: At least one of those things.
[SPEAKER_04]: If they didn't have that criteria, they weren't his customers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And could he have sold to other people?
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he does now, but his point was, this group of people gives me the highest chance of success, so I'm only gonna target, I'm only gonna talk to, and I'm only gonna sell to them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Roughly 10,000 people-ish.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's your target.
[SPEAKER_04]: Find something that has 10,000, so you can talk to 100 a day for 100 days, and then cycle again for the rest of the year.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll do it three times, and if you do that, if, big if, if you actually do that, you'll win.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, Kyle, any other questions?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, that was it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was super helpful for myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Jane.
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_04]: What's going on today?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Andy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good to see you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just came up, grabbed the mic to make your space a little more visible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also like the
[SPEAKER_01]: title here, High Leverage Skills, Personal Brand, and what you just said, you got to zero in on what it is your brand is going to be and what you're going to be all about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will make a statement as far as not all of us are meant to be entrepreneurs, but this concept can work just as well as if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: into a new career, which I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm leveraging my skills by going back to school and getting into the cyber security sector of healthcare because I used to be a nurse.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm taking what I used to have and blending it with something new so that I can leverage up and get into a field that is not laying off anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, there's definitely...
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, that I definitely believe in.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to leverage your skills, and you've got to zero in on what direction you're going in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And eventually, at some point, perhaps I can become an entrepreneur, but I need to spend some time
[SPEAKER_01]: working with the products and the situations to learn the ropes as an apprentice and an intern.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then maybe at some point, I will be able to go out on my own and be a private contractor or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of possibilities out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just got to use your imagination and be willing to work hard, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you know you can go faster
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's how you can go faster with cybersecurity.
[SPEAKER_04]: The first thing is go just search for cybersecurity certifications and get a couple certs in addition to a I'm not sure if you're going to Like a community college or a college.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm assuming that that's a bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: I could be a bad assumption, but You can go get certs
[SPEAKER_04]: You can just go to, I mean, there's a, I can list them off, but there's a whole bunch of places you can go get a, you know, go to Google.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, we did.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got a lot of, I'm taking a 12 week boot camp just to, because I need, I need some structure and that's going to prepare me for the A plus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just, I've been trying to hack my education that way, but
[SPEAKER_01]: I just need some structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I decided to take a course.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go with if you're going to do any education You have to have a some objective or goal at the end in mind.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to use this to take the next course I'm going to use this to go get a job.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to use this to to create more income.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to use this to buffer the Thing i'm going to use it so that i'm more valuable to my employer whatever the answer is If you just go take like I I have a friend of mine a personal dear friend he has
[SPEAKER_04]: I think three, he just got the latest one.
[SPEAKER_04]: He has like seven master's degrees and three doctorates.
[SPEAKER_04]: He has, I forget what the law degree in England, I forget what that is, he's from the UK.
[SPEAKER_04]: I forget what they call it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Barrister, I think.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe that's the right word.
[SPEAKER_04]: But he never stopped going to school.
[SPEAKER_04]: He takes a online class every single day.
[SPEAKER_04]: He has his whole entire career.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's ended up with this amazing set of credentials.
[SPEAKER_04]: And essentially, he and I do the same work.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I have way less credentials than he does.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: take your class, take your cert, and then if, you know, if you're looking to get hired by someone, go to, you know, the job boards and search for the criteria they're looking for.
[SPEAKER_04]: They'd say it out loud.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just, you know what, you can even use AI.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go to Perplexity or ChatGPT and say, go find the 10 most current job postings for whatever job you want, you know, cybersecurity engineer or consultant or analyst or whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then say, give me the list of criterias that they require.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then say, create a plan for me to go build and the fastest way, the least expensive fastest way I can achieve all of those certifications so I'll be qualified to apply for that job.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just go do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the kind of thing you need to use AI for.
[SPEAKER_04]: It will massively help you in that kind of area because how do you know what
[SPEAKER_04]: this university or this special program or if they're equivalent or not or what people are really asking for or whatever anyway so stuff like that that's that's where you should that is a place to start and then you choose your own path right so you got to get there anyway okay you gotta have a plan Sam well you know I really like Dave Ramsey I've met him a couple times and
[SPEAKER_04]: His whole point is you have to have a plan.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to have something written down.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called a budget.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you have to keep to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you have to spend less money than you make so that you can, quote unquote, save money.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so then you have saved money to invest.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's his five-step plan.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's really hard to dispute him and argue with Dave.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because Dave's like, if you have a budget,
[SPEAKER_04]: and you stick to it, you'll save money.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you save money, you'll have money.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most people are broke because they don't have any money.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then if you want to use that money to make more money, you invest it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Simple, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Hard, harder to do, but simple to explain.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, thank you for joining.
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, if you haven't noticed, the most important communication skill I have described, the most important high leverage skill, logic,
[SPEAKER_04]: which implies the fact that you have chosen some objective and then are using some kind of methodology, usually logic, to create a step-by-step plan to achieve your objective.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the highest leverage skill you can develop.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's essentially map reading.
[SPEAKER_04]: I live in Sacramento.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to drive to
[SPEAKER_04]: San Francisco or Los Angeles, I have to choose on the map which way to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to determine how far my vehicle will go, how many times I need to stop for electricity or gas, depending on which one it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where do I stop?
[SPEAKER_04]: How long is it going to take?
[SPEAKER_04]: What's my expected duration of time?
[SPEAKER_04]: Just basics from leaving here, what time do I get there?
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're creating a business, I'm starting with this idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to market, attract, and close people from being interested to being customers to paying me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then I have to deliver the thing to them, and I have to do enough of that so that the profit I generate from doing it produces a profit.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I create a profit, how much time and effort do I need to spend to do that in order to get to the profit objective I'm looking for?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a path.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called a business plan.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a written down set of these are the constraints, this is what we're delivering, this is our target audience, and then you just go through it.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the project world we call it a charter.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been hired to do this, to work with this group of people, to use their time effectively and this amount of budget to deliver this new set of computer functionality to the organization.
[SPEAKER_04]: The same thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just create a step.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's where we are today, this is where we wanna go, make a path.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is the first most important high leverage skill you can create.
[SPEAKER_04]: Second one is the ability to communicate it to other people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most people, by the way, can figure out a plan of how they're gonna get from where they are to their job, or where they are to school, or where they are to the restaurant, or wherever they're going.
[SPEAKER_04]: They can figure that out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Describing it to other people, whole different skill set.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the next skill set you should develop.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the third skill set to make all of it easier, do it in a way that makes you more likable than you are now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you do those three things, those are the three highest leverage skills.
[SPEAKER_04]: Logic to achieve an objective, the ability to communicate, here's where we are, here's the objective, and here's the path.
[SPEAKER_04]: And third, to do it in a way that's likable.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are my three high leverage skills.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a personal plug, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to go to my website, it's in my bio.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see the whole entire article where I write the whole thing out today.
[SPEAKER_04]: I posted little chunks of it on X.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll see it throughout the day.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's go to Jim.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, Jim.
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_05]: Good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Happy Thursday.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, almost the end of October, almost Halloween.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just spent the day with my dad.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, he's 90.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he had to go to see his financial advisor.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I had to make sure that they don't rip him off.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well if you're gonna take anybody I would I would like to take you because You have a tendency see what I like the most about Jim by the way I've talked to Jim on here a couple that but but I've seen his content I signed up for his newsletter and all that stuff right, but here's what I like the most about Jim
[SPEAKER_04]: He has a very specific filter that he looks at finances through, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: He's curated that for a long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he can look at anything and put that filter on, like putting on the pair of financial glasses and going, is this a good idea or a bad idea?
[SPEAKER_04]: And he can just go, oh, well, it doesn't meet any of these other criteria.
[SPEAKER_04]: It only meets this one, therefore it's bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or, hey, it meets a whole bunch of these criteria, it's good.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what comes through your content.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, financial advisors, they gotta make money, so they're always trying to sell something.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you just gotta make sure that my 90-year-old dad, who doesn't hear very well, a lot slower, doesn't do anything crazy that may be in the interest of the advisor as opposed to the client.
[SPEAKER_05]: Other than that, we have two launches booked.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I mentioned before, it's pretty simple to make money as a business.
[SPEAKER_05]: You get traffic, you get a lead magnet, and then you launch.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have two launches coming up, one in December, the New Year, Christmas type of thing, and then a high ticket in 2026.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've taken your approach, and in the last few days, have decided that I'm just going to share everything with everybody the entire time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I'll just give you, here's my big, giant plan.
[SPEAKER_04]: One, I've created an assessment tool or an audit tool for your personal brand and I've decided to niche down to teach people how to be a personal brand because I've done it for a long, long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I never realized it until I started talking about it and then I was like, you know, I've been doing this for 25 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so if you send me your email, I'll do a personal audit of your personal brand
[SPEAKER_04]: in exchange for your email, and then I'll put you on the email list and we'll send you stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're interested in how to fix that and make it better, I've got a little offer for $97 a month.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can buy, we'll send you a monthly audit and we'll send you all the suggestions that we think you should make to do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you take the suggestions and you do the stuff, it's going to increase your score.
[SPEAKER_04]: As a bonus, if you do that, we're going to put you on the subscriber list, but we're also going to send you 30 ideas about your personalized content for you, customized for your audience with your superpower.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to try to guess what those are, and then we're going to send you 30 ideas of things you can post content on.
[SPEAKER_04]: $97 a month if you want us to actually create content or take your content make it better It's like 500 bucks a month if you want us to actually do all that create the whole system coach you create the whole deal But it's like five grand a month.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's the whole package Oh, and there's one more if if you want me to fly out to your location with a film crew with videographers and camera people
[SPEAKER_04]: and do a podcast, live, with you, in person, and then take all the video, and all the content, and everything, and then produce all the content, and it's like 25 grand a month.
[SPEAKER_04]: Plus you get all the other stuff I just mentioned.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, there you go, that's my whole package.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you doing individual launches for each price point, or something like that?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, the first one is, essentially, my lead magnet is,
[SPEAKER_04]: If you need a personal brand, you don't know where you stand, send in your email and you can get on the list.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you send it in, you're gonna get a free personal brand audit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the rest of it comes as trickle campaign from the emails.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I'm going to do a launch.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did a pre-launch in September where I talked about all the stuff that I was doing, but I'm gonna do another launch in November.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanna do it the week before Thanksgiving,
[SPEAKER_04]: Black Friday or the weekend of Black Friday.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's my next launch.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I've got four weeks to go and we're building out the next launch.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the next launch will be basically that if you really want a personal brand and you want everything, we'll do it all for you for $5,000.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you can't afford that, we can produce the content, send it to you for 500 bucks.
[SPEAKER_04]: You get an email every morning with the content for the day.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've only done launches at every one price point.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't mix anything up.
[SPEAKER_05]: I kind of like this one's the
[SPEAKER_05]: This one's a $10,000 price point and we run a launch for that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then if I have a low ticket, I run a separate launch for that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't give the customer too much, I don't take up too much of their brain space to think about like, do I need A, B or C, low, medium or high?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just launching the high and then I'm launching the medium and then it takes longer, but I want the customer focused.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I,
[SPEAKER_04]: This is like the first big launch I've done, so I think you're right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll probably just pick one and do one thing, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Customers will drop off for any particular reason, just a little bit of difficulty, just one too many form fields or pull downs, one more extra step that they didn't anticipate, and then they're gone.
[SPEAKER_05]: So give them three products or services at three different price points and tell them, if you need A, B, C, or D, you've got to pay.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're just going to forget it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, that's my experience.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, well, it's ironic that you say that because
[SPEAKER_04]: on my consulting service, it's only one price.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, this is my price, this is the thing, you can either pay for it by deliverables, or you can pay by the hour, and this is how much we're gonna charge, and this is what you're gonna get.
[SPEAKER_04]: You get the same thing either way.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just, okay, you wanna hire us, cool, then here's how much it costs.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's roughly like 20, 25,000 a month, depending on the project.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I just sell that,
[SPEAKER_04]: And then either we deliver invoices by the hour, or we deliver invoices by deliverable, and we deliver every month for monthly reports and meetings and status and updates and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And ta-da, there you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we just send them the results.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I like it clean like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, well, you're right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's funny, because I
[SPEAKER_04]: This whole part of it, the whole personal branding is not new.
[SPEAKER_04]: Selling it as a service is a little new to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll just take that and notch it down to something even smaller.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, here's what it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's what we're offering.
[SPEAKER_04]: Take it or leave it.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't like it, then okay, I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just join the newsletter and we'll keep going and we'll get you next time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we do a five-day launch, so there's,
[SPEAKER_05]: I think if you follow Jeff Walker, he has a pre-pre-launch.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you warm up by, well, you can read the book.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to go over it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But basically, you can't buy anything for the first, I think, let's just say five days.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Five days, you can't buy anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're just reading the content and wetting your appetite.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you say, OK, tomorrow it's going to open.
[SPEAKER_05]: So now you can start buying it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Stripe is activated.
[SPEAKER_05]: They can take credit cards.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I push content on day one, two, three, four.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then on the last day we do triple of everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: So triple of the emails, triple of the video saying like, you got 20 hours, 10 hours, four hours, last hour.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, you know, and so we do that way.
[SPEAKER_05]: So five day launch with like hit, hit, hit, hit, and then triple on the last day.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we close it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then that's our, that's our launch.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's, in a nutshell, what we do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well then, I am going to target the last day for the sale on my next launch on the 28th of November.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, when's your Black Friday?
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys have Black Friday, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Coming up or something?
[SPEAKER_04]: That is Black Friday, the 28th of November.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, there you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: So 27th is Thanksgiving, and then 28th is Black Friday.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I have all my email sequences, you know, they're all preloaded.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I can just load them all up and send them off.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's, that's not that big a deal.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm using kit.com so that it doesn't matter if people join today, right, if they joined at 730 in the morning, they're going to get the eat the you know, the email drop at 8am they get that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it automatically updates the segments.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Amazing, well good luck, it sounds exciting.
[SPEAKER_05]: Launch in like in a month?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, well, along the way is all about content and then talking about personal branding and it's like, and by the way, if you're on this and you really want, just send me a DM with your email and I'll run the assessment and send it to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I call it an assessment, I think it's an audit's a better word, because it kind of feels like it's a little more, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, if you guys want a personal assessment, just DM Andy your email, he'll put it in the system, and you'll get that report, and everyone's good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and I've run it about 100 times for 100 different accounts, and I've already got pilot people doing it and using it, and I've got a company that's hired me to do their stuff, so yeah, it's starting to get some traction, so along the way, it's cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, I agree with your idea that
[SPEAKER_04]: One launch, one product, one thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: They either like it or they don't.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, less friction, less steps, 100%.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you heard it here first, guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: So get Andy or DMs in now, because once he's gone, who knows?
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe he's off like off gallivanting in Europe or something.
[SPEAKER_05]: So throw your emails to Andy, A-S-A-P.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, Jim.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, let's go to Stunspot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sam, what's going on?
[SPEAKER_04]: He created his own Harmozy bot, if you haven't seen that in the purple pill.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you there?
[SPEAKER_05]: Who are you trying to talk to right now?
[SPEAKER_05]: Someone raised their hand.
[SPEAKER_04]: Stunspot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, stone.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's he's on.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's unmuted, but I can't hear you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sam, you might have to take a lap.
[SPEAKER_04]: Come back.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to drop you down.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to, okay, I'm going to remove you from speakers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just go ahead and hit the hit the invite again.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'll get you up here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I see Justin in the audience.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wealthy's in the audience.
[SPEAKER_04]: Golden TVD.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people who come and listen every day.
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate you guys every day.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ant and Steven.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's happening, Steven?
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, Steven, I got a question for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you, last time I posted about your music, you posted an album.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that you?
[SPEAKER_04]: Give me a thumbs up if that was you last time you posted that album.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wasn't sure if that was you in a previous life or some other version of what you had or if it was something that you liked.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, maybe Steve is not near the button to push his push the thumbs up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go to Justin.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey Justin.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's going on today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh Yeah, Andy just working away in the background here just thought I'd pop in and you know support space listen in learn a little bit so but yeah, really
[SPEAKER_00]: Really enjoyed our morning space, and yeah, good to see everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope everyone's having a great Thursday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I just got an email from Jim, too, about his Home Depot experience, so that was funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, good to see everyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so back, level set the room.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got high leverage skills for your personal brand, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So for me, the high level skills are first,
[SPEAKER_04]: The logic to pick an objective and to create a plan to get there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't have to be perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just have to know which direction to go and kind of the steps to get there.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can figure it out a little bit later, but you need to have some written down objective.
[SPEAKER_04]: Second thing is you have to be able to communicate that to more than one person, unless you're by yourself and nobody depends on you and you don't need anybody else to help you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And even then,
[SPEAKER_04]: You might want to talk out loud to something like Grok or ChatGPT or Perplexity so that it can help you understand if you've done all the right things or if you're missing something.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then third is to tell that communication in a way that makes you more likable if possible.
[SPEAKER_04]: And by the way, notice I didn't say become a great communicator, become a great planner, become a great likable person or the most likable person in the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: I said become a little more planning, a little more communicating, a little more likable.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just wherever you are is where you start and you have to take one step towards that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the reason that I say that, to be obvious, is that you cannot reach your goals
[SPEAKER_04]: as the person you are, or you would have already done it.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have new goals that are beyond your current scope and capture and abilities, you have to become a better version of yourself.
[SPEAKER_04]: A little bit, a lot, whatever it takes for you, but you have to become a little better version of yourself in order to achieve those things.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why we become a little better communicator, a little better in
[SPEAKER_04]: our mindset a little better in the details and in likability.
[SPEAKER_04]: Aw, Skunspud just sent me a note, says the annoying audio stuff, sorry, wanted to take a note while avoiding decision paralysis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Choice load is important, so anchoring.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you 100% want two or three price points optimally set, hey, this is the cool thing and then the cool thing plus this big bolt-on unified expansion.
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I was thinking about doing it the opposite way.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I appreciate the, oh, he's gone, he's not even here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was gonna do it the other way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the big price point, and people go, yeah, ooh, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, okay, well, if you can't really afford that, I've got this drop-down offer that you can have.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I was, that's what I was thinking.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we'll see.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I have another four weeks to put together the rest of the launch and to tease it the rest of the day.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is the way to get into any of that little ecosystem with Andy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Send me your email and a DM and I will create and send the audit to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I do have a landing page, but it only worked yesterday and this morning it's not working.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I'm not giving you the landing page link, but otherwise, just send me your DM, DM me your email and I will create the audit and send it to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, okay, what have we got?
[SPEAKER_04]: We got 20 minutes left.
[SPEAKER_04]: What else do we wanna talk about?
[SPEAKER_04]: Who else has a question?
[SPEAKER_04]: Grab the mic, come up, ask your questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Otherwise, Justin and I will talk more about
[SPEAKER_04]: your Google AdSense and Google homepages and why blogs have long tails SEO more than any other thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I guess we're going to talk about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, here's a crazy stat, and I don't know if I told this before, but, hi Netta, here's a crazy stat.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you, Netflix has 36,000 hours of content, okay?
[SPEAKER_04]: Netflix, 36,000 hours of content, big giant company, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Users upload 36,000 hours of content to YouTube.
[SPEAKER_04]: Users uploading 36,000 hours of content every three days.
[SPEAKER_04]: crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, Netta.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, I have.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm very happy to be here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Justin, I will respond.
[SPEAKER_03]: We will send you the question that you asked in the group chat on LinkedIn later on today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Want to make sure I acknowledge that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would love, love, love to hear perspectives on.
[SPEAKER_03]: What did I want to ask?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yesterday we talked a bit about not being too available for people and the space that I was talking about, the hunt, you said put it to two hours and relating that to personal brand, not being too available for people, that gives them the perception of scarcity, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: How does that
[SPEAKER_03]: Affect your personal brand.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm curious because I know late.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know like another person could potentially answer this besides Justin is also and yourself is Jim Tom, he's on the call even in the yep, and Stay, all right okay, so it I Look at it like this
[SPEAKER_04]: When I'm online, I'm available here.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can come ask your question.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can grab the mic.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can ask me anything you want.
[SPEAKER_04]: But as you know, if you DM me, I may not be able to get to you for another four, because at one o'clock, I've got a bunch of other meetings going on.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I have a bunch of client activities between now and four, between one o'clock and 4.30 PM today.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so as a result, you're not going to get any engagement from me.
[SPEAKER_04]: for the next four or five hours.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you may get some engagement with me later, but then I'm not always available.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm available during this time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this exclusivity is, you can come talk to Andy anytime you want.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can take the mic, you can ask me any question, I'll answer anything I have directly from the heart, nothing held back.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm not gonna be online and I'm not gonna answer my phone for the next 12 hours.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the way I look at exclusivity.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the second thing is, if you want to hire me, I'm only available for certain periods of time during the day to do work for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Otherwise, it's either going to be some kind of automated system or somebody else doing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that exclusivity is very clear.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm busy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I carve out my lunchtime to talk to everybody on X.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what I do.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm willing to sacrifice my lunchtime to talk to you guys, but the rest of the time's pretty much mine.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how I do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go ahead, Jim.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I had this conversation with my business partner yesterday, so I'm never available.
[SPEAKER_05]: So scarcity is for me, it's like, I used to do TikTok live, Instagram live, Facebook live and all that stuff, but now I'm like, it's not, it doesn't really further my brand to be available, especially when my time is being billed right now at a thousand an hour.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't usually like doing that because it's only one hour and it's not really scalable.
[SPEAKER_05]: So,
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah so we talked about that and because I was saying like should we do some more lives because you know a lot of people going live and
[SPEAKER_05]: We feel, or in our opinion, that it would make our live events that we launch less valuable or harder to justify if you can see me every day, or if you can talk to me every day or every week, then our live events, which our high ticket might be based off next year, they'll be like, well, why do I need to pay for this?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, Jim's live every day.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just said, yeah, forget it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not live.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to get to that point.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, when I know I want to get to the I want to get to the point where I'm too busy, where I'm too busy to be available every day.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm only available, I'm available to co host in the mornings.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm available for one hour during lunchtime, five days a week.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, no, no, sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if I'm a failure.
[SPEAKER_05]: I am available.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just, I'm not available.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, like, yeah, I am.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm not available to spend time with you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, no offense.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to say it in a rude way.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm available 24-7 because I don't actually work a job and do anything besides make my, you know, three or four pieces of content a day.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just not available for my followers or customers or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_04]: Neda, did that answer your question?
[SPEAKER_03]: Selective availability.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it gives you a, it's all about perception at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: You value yourself therefore you limit your availability to others therefore people will perceive you as an authoritative figure Sorry, not not like a dictator.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean like someone that Knows what they're doing what they're talking about not to say that you don't Jim not at all But I'm saying it's all a question of perception at the end of the day.
I
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I understood.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And also, like, there's a reason why Warren Buffett said that he keeps his calendar empty and he says no to all his meetings because, you know, he can buy anything he wants, he says, but he can't buy time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so he really guards his time very.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very much so.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's just sort of like if someone wants to spend X hours with me, I would rather, even though it costs me money, spend time with my dad, my daughter, my wife.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would just rather do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's why Warren Buffett charges $200 million for lunch.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I mean, because he's like, unless it's for charity or something really worthwhile, I'd rather spend time with the people I like.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he plays bridge.
[SPEAKER_05]: and the ukulele on his free time.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, I totally get that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go ahead, Justin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two different ways to think about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing is think about context to the platform, because that really needs to be taken into consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, for example, X, you know, you look at those people who are putting in so many hours here on this platform.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, I'm kind of with Andy on this, like I'm really limited on my time these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think everyone is limited on their time these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you just gotta be respectful of your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like maybe have the hunt like two, three hours max, something like that, but cap it because I think that'll add, you know, urgency and,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, exclusivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a, that's a better approach in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as far as other platforms like, you know, take talk and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I would just say you, you want, you want to maybe tease things, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of marketing is, you know, fear of missing out, but also like tease things where you want to get more of an audience, more distribution,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, bigger numbers where you can tease certain things like, Hey, I have this launch coming up, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or I have our quarterly launch coming up and, you know, maybe do some surprise pop-ups because I think those are really intriguing and they've worked well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've had some pop-up spaces in the past with Timo, for example, that have just like, we've gotten a thousand people, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, I think using those types of strategies and tactics will further your brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know you want to be predictable and dependable, but you also want to sprinkle in some Some surprises every now and then because people appreciate that so but yeah, I mean and And it's got to be a progression right so you know Jim didn't get to $1,000 an hour like overnight, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like he progressively got there and same with me like I didn't get to a $500 an hour like
[SPEAKER_00]: you know yesterday like this is like a 25 year journey that's taken me to this point so um but you just have to calculate like hey what is my cost opportunity cost of doing this thing versus that thing and really come up with a number and um and yeah like i'm with jim and andy like i would much rather spend time with like great people and my family and my inner circle um but at the same time i love helping people
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love helping people on X. I love, you know, teaching, educating, inspiring, and, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, just, but at the end of the day, like time is money, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Time is money.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to respect our time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why I'm really diligent and, uh, uh, very obsessive when it comes to managing my calendar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, so yeah, hopefully those are some helpful tips Netta, but, but yeah, like protect your time and, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: be very mindful of your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, you'll just see that time becomes more valuable as you age.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I always go through like an opportunity cost or cost benefit analysis of, okay, do I wanna do this or not?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's that gonna cost me?
[SPEAKER_00]: What can I not do with that time?
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, hopefully that helps, but yeah, good discussion, thanks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Any follow-up, Neda?
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to audit my time a lot better because many of you know I want to switch to event program management, so organized events, organized conferences, thus why I'm doing a lot of spaces to practice, but also to gain the skills that I want for that, to have a portfolio of projects to show, have the numbers,
[SPEAKER_03]: But I have five events happening every week.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very soon, it's going to be five.
[SPEAKER_03]: Spaces, live streams, and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm managing a conference as well that's going to be held in Toronto, Canada in August.
[SPEAKER_03]: So plus full-time work.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really need to audit my time more carefully.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the ROI at the end of all this will be a career transition altogether, an entire career.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, time is a big deal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go to Rinald.
[SPEAKER_04]: How's it going, Rinald?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an honor to be here among these big accounts and to talk to you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an absolute honor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just wanted to talk about that same subject.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very interesting for me here on X that
[SPEAKER_02]: There's very, very important people that I've met that are using an alternate account on these platforms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they give their time.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are very, very important people, and they give their time to everybody, to real simple people here on X.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just think that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: How can that even happen?
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and, um, a people that, that are, they have actually seen it on YouTube too, that like a Elon Musk giving time to the everyday astronaut hours and hours of interviews.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the everyday astronaut was a very small account on YouTube, a very small channel.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he, he chose to give the, the everyday astronaut his time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though the everyday astronaut wasn't like time magazine or something like that, you know, it was, he chose the little guy instead.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and to, to think, you know, that's the richest person in the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: That may be the difference between getting to 500 billion, instead of just staying stuck at a hundred billion, like Warren Buffett, you know, that makes Elon completely special, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we have five minutes left.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have a question?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, my question is doesn't it seem fake to control your time and and manage it like like you're this very important person?
[SPEAKER_02]: Doesn't that give it a little bit of fakeness, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other one complete authenticity that you just give your time where you want to with love Okay, I have a I have a
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a question.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you, are you married?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have a family?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have children?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if I just said, Hey, I want you to talk to me for the next nine hours.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wouldn't you at some point say, yeah, but I have to go spend time with my kids.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to go have dinner with my family.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got to go take care of some other things and I'll be back.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, of course.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so if it's yes, of course, that means you have a prioritization in your mind about what things are important to you, what things are important to everybody to for your perception of your things that are important to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the rest of the world can be do its own thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I totally understand that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just apply that to just apply that to more than just your family.
[SPEAKER_04]: If, if you
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, I could spend eight hours a day on X, hosting spaces or co-hosting or just speaking on spaces.
[SPEAKER_04]: Does that actually benefit me towards my objectives?
[SPEAKER_04]: If yes, well then doing it is a good idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: If it doesn't, then doing it is a bad idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yet even if everyone else, even if there was a million people asking me to join, if it was a bad idea, it's still a bad idea and I just don't do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I get to choose.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as part of a family, if you have children, assuming you're a father, if you're a father and you have children, you can choose them over everything else.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is just a human condition and, in my opinion, a human right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You get to choose how to spend your own time.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the only thing we can't get more of.
[SPEAKER_04]: You cannot get more time.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can hire people to do work for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can hire people to make food for you so you don't have to spend the time doing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you still have to do something during that.
[SPEAKER_04]: The clock is undefeated at the moment.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't end.
[SPEAKER_04]: And because it's a limited resource, if you think of it that way, it is the only limited resource.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so therefore, each one of us as human beings, whether we choose to or not, we get to, we're allowed to, and in my opinion, you should control, manage, and curate your own time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an honor that you gave me this time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an honor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hope that helps.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thinking through things, which is
[SPEAKER_04]: The very first high leverage skill that I recommend everybody develop, and that is how to make a plan to go from where you are to somewhere different, okay?
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't matter what that is.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't matter how you do it, whether you're learning how to play Monopoly, or you're learning how to use a map, or you're learning how to navigate your hunger.
[SPEAKER_04]: Getting the skill set
[SPEAKER_04]: And developing the skill set to create a written plan is a skill we all inherently have, but you should develop it to a point of expertise.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the second skill you should develop is the skill of communicating, and the best way is to communicate that plan to other people.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then third skill you should develop is likability, a little bit more likable, so that when you are describing and communicating to other people, they're not offended or want to run away or thinking, oh God, when's he going to shut up?
[SPEAKER_04]: And with that,
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to say thank you for everybody for joining.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've reached the end of our time today and I do have to leave.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the reason that I do these things, just to be super obvious and clear.
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, if you want your personal brand audit, we're going to talk about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: For the next month or so if you want just send me your email in a DM And I will put that in my system create the audit for you and send it to you So if you want that you can do that But the reason I do this is because I firmly believe that the world needs entrepreneurs they need magic they need you there are people right now on their hands and knees begging God for the solution that you have and
[SPEAKER_04]: And you need the courage to create your own business.
[SPEAKER_04]: You need the courage to follow and do the same things that we're doing, that Jim talked about, that I talked about, that Justin does, that Netta is working on, that Jane is working on.
[SPEAKER_04]: You need to pick up your torch and do the same thing because the world is cold and dark and only
[SPEAKER_04]: It only gets better if we all pick up our torches, light them, and carry that glow, that light, and that warmth into the cold, dark world.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's what I suggest you do.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I hope you do.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I'm here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Grab your torch, carry it out into the dark world, because they need you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks again.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys have a great day.
[SPEAKER_04]: See you tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye.
