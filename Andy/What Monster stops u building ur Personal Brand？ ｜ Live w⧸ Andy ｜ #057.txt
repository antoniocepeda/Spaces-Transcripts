[SPEAKER_01]: All right, good afternoon.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's noon on the October 28th, Tuesday, 1028.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to talk about the monsters that stop you from building your personal brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the monsters that stop you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Monsters meaning the things that you're afraid of, the things you can't... Hey Andy, how are you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, what's going on?
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me a minute and then I'll get to you in a sec here, okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the... Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, what's going on Melrose?
[SPEAKER_01]: I love your stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's get into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the monster that holds you from your personal brand?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm here to learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're here to learn.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a lot of personal branding issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I changed my profile picture, I think once every three weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that can be a challenge, can it?
[SPEAKER_01]: It reminds me of, do you remember the movies?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you ever see the movie Stripes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know the beginning when the guys do an interrogation and he asks them a bunch of weird questions and they go, well, we're not right now, but you know, we're willing to learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm kind of feeling like, you know, are you,
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have a personal brand?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a monster?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, no, but I'm willing to have one if that's necessary.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, kind of cracked me up there a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why do you change your profile picture every few weeks?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I get bored.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just get tired of seeing the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then as a person, I change.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I just come up with new ideas.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know that I had a better profile picture, like a more engaging one, like a few profile pictures ago, but I'm still just going with new ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's personal brand is you.
[SPEAKER_01]: If everybody thinks, you know, hey, what are you doing this week, then that can work for you, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The only point I'm trying to make is for personal brand, it's like your digital persona.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you want people to find you,
[SPEAKER_01]: what, who are they?
[SPEAKER_01]: What tool do they use?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what is the tool?
[SPEAKER_01]: How does it show you instead of other people?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really the question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Andy, I definitely struggle with finding my target demographic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say that's probably my biggest struggle.
[SPEAKER_01]: But okay, so you're a comedian.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what what is it that you want to?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you I mean, you just change your profile picture again.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is it that you want
[SPEAKER_01]: Who do you want your audience to be?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your goal?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's start there.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is your goal?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you want to do?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I have a special I'm working on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess I want to release this special on it to be somewhat successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK. Let's get into the details.
[SPEAKER_01]: What does successful mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you could have what you want, what would happen?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I think I just want to be part of the conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason I became a comedian was because I just wanted to give back to all the people that made me laugh as a kid.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they got me through a lot of tough times.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the reason I became a comic was to do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I could just have people that say they enjoyed it and it made them laugh, that'd be enough for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So who is it that typically laughs at your material?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what's crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, it's all types of people.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, you know, it's, it's, it's sense of humor is not exactly on top, you know, on everybody's forehead.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like, I have moms that like what I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got, you know, 18 year old kids that like what I do, but there's some people that just absolutely hate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my problem is I can't find, I'm trying to find the right demographic or like the right people that have my type of sense of humor.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's obviously impossible when it varies in so many different demographics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well,
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I, I think comedy is like music.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, the music I really like, my wife doesn't really like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I listen to the music that I like, when I'm, you know, alone in my office, not necessarily when I'm around her.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not because of anything bad, just because, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: She doesn't really care for that kind of music, which is no big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing with comedy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a, it's a personal taste, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people like this beer or that beer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people like wine better than beer or vice versa.
[SPEAKER_01]: None of them are good or bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the point then is how are you going about building an audience?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm kind of just trying to like,
[SPEAKER_02]: Host stuff and then curate like people who like it and the people who like it their friends will like it But for the most part, it's just it's kind of just posting I don't really do like I've tried the the basic methods and I just I don't like any of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know Okay, so let's the personal brand is the easiest way to build a personal brand is to pick a target and
[SPEAKER_01]: And then move towards that target.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I typically help people with is choose your voice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you've got a good understanding of what that is, but choose your audience and choose your superpower comedy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what kind of comedy?
[SPEAKER_02]: Dark.
[SPEAKER_02]: How dark?
[SPEAKER_02]: I lean towards dark comedy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to be like, I was the guy that does the 1am sets and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I cleared the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that what you want, to clear the room?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do you want people to keep coming?
[SPEAKER_02]: Nah, because I think comedy is like 50% horrifying, 50% funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe in the old Patrisse O'Neill logic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like well, there's definitely definitely shock and twist right so Setting up a story where everyone expects it to go one way and then you take them a different way and give them a punchline sideways or above or below whatever that's totally part of comedy and like tough topics Andy like Abortion things like that stuff that people don't want to talk about
[SPEAKER_02]: Comedy is about, my favorite type of comedy is taking the most horrific thing you can think of and finding the funny in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's the true skill set of comedy is looking at a horrible, horrible situation or thing and then trying to find the one piece that everybody can agree on and laugh about.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the truth is not everybody is always going to agree on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you don't need everyone to agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a decent amount of haters too, so I have a good amount of people that follow me just to comment hateful things rather than positive things.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time, it's all branding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there have been dark comedians who were very successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just gotta push through.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember, it's about the audience escaping their life, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So as long as you can help people escape their life, that's what comedy and TV and all these, that's all they do, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They help you escape your current situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some people, they like to escape their current situation by pointing out that everything else could be so much worse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's some funny things in this even so much worse than my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's, I mean, the how bad can it get is the is the definition of blues music.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, but comedy is comedy is storytelling with laughter instead of a point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can make points too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to pick a group of people, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the people who like your comedy, they all have something in common.
[SPEAKER_01]: They like your comedy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what is it about your comedy that attracts them?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it the dark humor?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it the punchline?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it the stories?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it the presentation?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it the whole thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who am I?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not a comedian expert.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's because I hit angles that most comedians don't go for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'll like I'll shoot it almost anything most comedians will like save themselves for the big stuff Oh, oh, I'll burn like a special worthy joke in a morning for no reason Most comedians wouldn't do that But your audience Your audience if they like you they'll like all of you and all of the things you bring not just a
[SPEAKER_01]: for the chocolate at the end of the day, or the end of the story.
[SPEAKER_02]: All I really bring is the chocolate.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a comedian.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all I'm supposed to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, the audience, the reason people go, why do you think most people go to a comedy show or listen to a comedy special or listen to a comedian or a video or whatever, read a book?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why are they doing that?
[SPEAKER_01]: To feel better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, because their life is like something bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they want to feel something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why people get into every every other type of, of distractive behavior is because we don't want to deal with our life the way it is at that moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we, and so we are looking for distraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some people are extremely happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's, it's Halloween,
[SPEAKER_01]: There are literally going to be people who make a cake that looks like a real person cut it up and serve it to people because it's funny Because it's a little twisted and dark people are going to dress up and and try to scare little kids in the next couple days They're going to try to scare each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to try to make it feel Whatever And it's some of its innocent fun and some of it's really dark.
[SPEAKER_01]: But right now during halloween time
[SPEAKER_01]: all of that stuff happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: My point is, there is a huge, huge audience for dark humor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just look at what's going to happen in the next three or four days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at every single TV show, every single movie that's being promoted on pick one, Netflix, Disney, Hulu, Amazon, they're all the Halloween movies, which are all horror.
[SPEAKER_01]: And
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes a little comedy thrown in for comic relief of the horror but there's a ton of people who are interested in going dark and and going oh That was a that was a crazy joke, but they laugh at it or they just kept coming back All you want is people to join and listen to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I you know, I read this story I maybe you can help me because you're in comedy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I read a story about a comedian that has a
[SPEAKER_01]: Email list he has like a web page.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a single page and an email list and it's like five bucks a month and the whole thing is if you pay the five bucks a month you get the email to the invite to his once a month show that he does on like zoom or something and He has but here's the crazy thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got like 200,000 people that pay him five bucks a month What comedian is this?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking, I'm looking it up right now while we're talking, but some crazy number of, uh, it's really great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, what an amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm digital.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm basically digital now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't do as many shows as I used to, um, unless I feature.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm picking up what you're putting down.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want, I want that guy's gig gig.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I'm looking up right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: John Oliver.
[SPEAKER_00]: John Oliver.
[SPEAKER_02]: John Oliver is the guy from last week tonight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: He said he does private zoom comedy show he did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, but the thing is that he, he got his some crazy amount of people who, who joined his email list.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but it's off the back of his show.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think his show was on last week.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tonight has millions and millions and millions of views.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's on like what, HBO?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's off the back of his HBO show.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't really mean that much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm coming from the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a potato.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you got to build you got to build an audience.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's just like every other way, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to you got to
[SPEAKER_01]: Go where the people are and you got to do the comedy and you got to produce stuff and promote it just like it's any other business, any other opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I want to be a speaker, I want to do a TED talk, I have to go to the TED people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to submit my stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to send it in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to give them a couple things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got to tell them exactly what I'm going to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got to give them samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then eventually, you know, they'll choose me and then I can get on and become a, a Ted speaker.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can do the same thing, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's, there's nothing stopping you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and yes, if you already famous, it's going to give you a lot more information, but most people would be happy with a hundred people on an email list.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most, I think most Twitter accounts only have less than 500 followers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, just start somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do your thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do a live on Twitter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just go, hey everybody, I'm doing a live comedy show next week, Tuesday, for 45 minutes, or 30 minutes, or 10 minutes, whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just hit it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then copy it, record it, post it, put it on YouTube, and then link the crap out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Submit it everywhere you can on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's just, it's the same old, same old stuff, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Personal brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why comedians only do one special per year, because I would be, if I did that, I could do that once a year, because of how much material I would be burning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because once you say it, it's gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: So once I write the joke and say it out loud to an audience, it's gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if you record it, maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: But here's the thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are lots and lots of bands that got made millions of dollars playing the exact same five songs in 50 cities a year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, unfortunately, that used to work because the 50 cities didn't know about each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now it's like social media is so
[SPEAKER_02]: integrated with, with life and stuff where people just like, rather than go see a comedy show, people just look at their phones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if I asked you, like, what do you want to do to make yourself laugh?
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd probably open up TikTok.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to look at the most recent comedian visiting your area.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what it used to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's, it's a completely different, uh, it's, I would say it's a completely different genre now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even think standup comedy as it, as it is really exists anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: So are you on TikTok?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm on TikTok, but that's kind of my hard pivot is, uh, I've had some success on there, but obviously because I'm a dark comic, they, uh, block a lot of my material.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, if I got banned on X, I can imagine I'm going to get banned on another social media site.
[SPEAKER_02]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it, well, I think it seems like you just have a marketing problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me, let me give you a, my gut check.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could tease, you could tell some funny jokes, some whatever g rated PG rated jokes on tik tok and everything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the end of it go, if you like more, you should come to the the dark show the full special the whatever, and then just
[SPEAKER_01]: Put that as a call to action every time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or just go, look, I'm putting together a special.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's targeted right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be in November.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you want to know the best way to get a hold of it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Join my email list.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're free.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to kit.com or beehive.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look up Beehive or Kit or MailerLite.
[SPEAKER_01]: They all have free programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: You put up a landing page and then you just tell people to go to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need a domain.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can just go sign up free and then just create a landing page and say,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm all for emails.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I, you know, when I worked in consulting, tech consulting, I was a drip campaign marketer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then, you know, I just don't think, and as a guy that spent years marketing on email and LinkedIn, I think, uh, email as in terms of a marketing tool is pretty much done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like everyone, your emails is junk mail.
[SPEAKER_02]: 90% of the time, nobody's checking that shit for real information.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the only way you're really going to get ahold of people
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess in today's society, is through their direct social media.
[SPEAKER_02]: But trying to take advantage of their email address, I think is a lost cause, which is why a lot of those, I guess, applications that used to find people's emails, like ZoomInfo, have kind of just fallen off over the past few years, because their information is so outdated.
[SPEAKER_02]: DreamNerd does not agree with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: He thinks that email is still in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do, I do too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think email is, okay,
[SPEAKER_01]: I have done all of my consulting, I've done all of my communications and all of my contracts have all started and ended with email for my consulting company.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I still think that there is a... How old are you Andy?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm 60.
[SPEAKER_02]: the
[SPEAKER_02]: communication tools was email.
[SPEAKER_02]: So of course, if you're in your 60s, you're still very attached to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So is my father, who's 57.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think the focus now, if you really want to gain anyone younger than about 40 years old, 30 years old, is going to be not email.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's just me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so I did, I'm going to pull up, you can't see this, but I'm going to pull up a, I did some research on the locations and the types of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you are a IT person between 25 and 40, so that's kind of you, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The number one place you're going to connect or be looking for work, job information, LinkedIn first.
[SPEAKER_01]: X second, and then the other, the other things like targeted ads, podcasts, online communities, et cetera, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a biz owner and you're 25 to 40, it's LinkedIn and then email and then referrals and then Twitter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and then it goes back and forth, but the bottom line is if you're over 40,
[SPEAKER_01]: email is email and newsletters is the primary channel that they will interact with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: And but if you're if you're under 40, the primary channel is going to be some kind of system where you get a DM, you're going to react with DM more than you're going to react to an email.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cool thing is, you can operate DMS
[SPEAKER_01]: very close to the same kind of idea as email.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only difference is where your audience goes first.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's an idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to somebody who has a big account and on X,
[SPEAKER_01]: Use your browser, click whoever you want to pick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doesn't matter who it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pick somebody who possibly has the same kind of community, same kind of demographic you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Find their audience, and then send them a, you know, go look at their account, find something interesting about them and say, follow them, and then say, hey, love to talk, love to do, I do comedy, I'd love to talk to you about whatever you do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just engage.
[SPEAKER_01]: with, I mean, be the reply guy, but be the reply DM guy, and just get more people engaged with you in a conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if it's just, yeah, F you, you know, stop bothering me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, cool, you know, I got this funny comedy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just ask him again, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hit him up and tell him that you're gonna have a comedy special, and that you're gonna do some of your pre-launch material on Saturday for like 15 minutes, and if you wanna make sure you get the email to it,
[SPEAKER_01]: Click here and we'll we'll sign you up.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll either send you a text or a dm or a or an email You can do that The point is the marketing is the same Now you're right, I think as I get closer to the special it'll be easier to market but since I don't really have any like concrete, I guess
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I could like make, I could post the image of the special and then promote that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time, I don't think there's any benefit to doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you actually have to like post some jokes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you can do that too, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you've got a phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're on a phone, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take your phone, get a tripod or put a book up so it stands against it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Push the button, tell your joke, copy it, paste it, post it everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then go, yeah, I wish comedy was that simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, well, to some degree, it is here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's the point.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't matter if you tell the okay, it's social media.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you tell the joke one time you put it on your your put it on your timeline, doesn't matter if it's tick tock, x, Instagram, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many people are going to actually see it?
[SPEAKER_01]: How long does that joke live on the internet forever?
[SPEAKER_01]: But how often is it pushed in front of other people?
[SPEAKER_01]: 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which means you literally could put in 10 jokes and I'm only gonna see one of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe, maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's in the right cycle of time, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: I may not see any of your jokes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But eventually if I see one and then I see the next one, I go, oh this is a funny guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see the next one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, and then every time you tell the joke and then you go, yeah we're just trying out material.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is probably garbage.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way, I'm gonna,
[SPEAKER_01]: I do I literally do what I'm about to say all the time I Say something and then I immediately deprecate it and say This is what I'm thinking, but I'm probably a giant idiot, but here's what I'm thinking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it works for you Maybe I'm a spig dummy and you can correct me Okay Do the same thing with your comedy I Don't like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: What would you do that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Why would you be like, why would you be like, I'm a big dummy?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because why wouldn't you just like be assertive with what you said?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I'll tell you why.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because first of all, I am a big dummy most of the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Secondly, I'm a big dummy because I'm an expert in two or like, if you took 360 degree view of my life, two, three, 4% of it, two or three or four degrees of it, I'm expert.
[SPEAKER_01]: The rest of it, I'm like everybody else, I'm average or worse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the stuff I don't even know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, even though I know how to do a few things really well, that doesn't mean I know how to do everything really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, for the most part, I might be in the right direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm probably not exactly perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And somebody can come in and help me.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't get that leeway in comedy, Andy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't get that extra, like, oh, we'll give them the benefit of the doubt.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not talking about when you're performing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm talking about the marketing lead up to the performance.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a difference, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The promotion is different than right, hitting them with a punchline.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have I have done comedy, but I did it as a waiter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's be honest, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I only had a blink of time to make him chuckle.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I did that for like five years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I made lots of people laugh.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could tell the same joke every table because there are different people every time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I totally understand that difference there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's still the same hook, story, punchline.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's always true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether you do it all at one, like Stephen Wright, who would just say one, do the setup, and then the punchline, and the whole thing was a twist.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you do Dave Chappelle that sets it up, tells a story, adds to the story, adds another thing to the story, and then hits it with a punchline at the end, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't matter who it is, whether it's Carlin or Steve Martin or whoever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pick your favorite comedian, current or past.
[SPEAKER_01]: They all did the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the funny part is, and this is what is still true,
[SPEAKER_01]: People still listen to Eddie Murphy's raw album because he was brilliant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if they've listened to it 10 or 15 or 20 times, it's still funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing with social media.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your joke might be funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might listen to it four or five times because it hits me each time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And your special,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, how did you get how did you get all the material to do to get a special or to put together enough material for that much time?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you had to try all this stuff and then tweak it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, well, that was a good the setup was good to set up a good the point that it didn't hit it quite hard enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me twist it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me let me change the how, you know, phrase it this way or hit it this way.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've you've tested all this stuff to make it work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just saying, make the tests part of the marketing
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I think they are right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like a lot of it's like, I'll post a joke and then if it blows up, I'll fucking bank it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like a lot of it's built on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and do more because if people like you, they like all your stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they don't like you, they don't like any of your stuff and they are not your audience.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you build an audience...
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even know where my audience is, Andy.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the whole point of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even know where my audience is.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Listen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Post your jokes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ask for feedback.
[SPEAKER_01]: Post your jokes when somebody goes, oh dude, that was funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, now you amplify that one more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or whatever that was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You just... Whatever you do...
[SPEAKER_02]: So many demographics of people though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be like, oh, that was funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like literally a thousand different demographics of people.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like one group of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but that's, do you think demographic is the only way to define an audience?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I'm defining my audience right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a comedian, your audience is the people who laugh at your jokes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but it's my demographic.
[SPEAKER_01]: But whoever, you know, the circle is not defined by the demographics.
[SPEAKER_01]: The circle is defined by who laughs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they're in the circle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I kind of get it, but I also don't get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're trying to say, Andy's a six foot two, 60 year old white guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: He may not laugh at my joke.
[SPEAKER_01]: My point is, if I laugh at your joke, you need to include other 60 year old white guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not the other way around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't define your graphic, don't define your audience first.
[SPEAKER_01]: For a comedian, do your material and see if people laugh.
[SPEAKER_01]: If people laugh, figure out who's laughing and who's looking at you like, you know, with a side eye, like, dude, really?
[SPEAKER_01]: You went there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's true no matter what as well, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I can't figure it out, that's what I mean.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like such a weird, diverse group of people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, the people that give you this hideout are not the people you'd expect.
[SPEAKER_01]: But probably the people who laugh aren't the ones you'd expect either.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's also true.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like that's what I'm saying, it's impossible for me to find my audience and market to them specifically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's not impossible.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might be difficult, but I think you're looking at it backwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at it a different way.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to build your personal brand, be you, the authentic, crazy, weird, dark you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And other people will follow you and they will go, oh, that guy's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people who don't follow you, who think you're not funny because of whatever their own reason is, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you can make a living if you had an email list of, you know, 1000 to 10,000 people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all you have to do for that is to ask, tell your jokes, make your funny comments, totally rip on whatever you're doing, whatever's funny, whatever's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of it's gonna hit, some of it's gonna crash, who cares?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just take the ones, if something hits, if it outperforms, do more of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And outperform meaning like more.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you post a joke, and you get 10 likes, or you just get 10 views, and then you post when it gets 100 views, do more of that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then pretty soon all of them are getting 100 and one of them gets 110.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, Ooh, maybe more of that, whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can be scientific about this, because that's what you did in the email marketing side.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I put this hook at the front, if I make it a whole sentence, if I just make it three words, if I, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole hook, stop the scroll, set up for the joke, punchline, call to action.
[SPEAKER_01]: Want more of this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Click here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, be sure to follow me so you can see all my jokes.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a reason why people say, hey, make sure you like and subscribe because it really makes a difference
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to go down, if you want to promote the, if you want to like this space and repost this space, it makes a difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: More people will come if you guys do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's the way the algorithm works.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Andy, if I can add something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Andy, I don't want to take any more of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no worries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hit me up on the back end if you want to talk about it more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Harsh, what's going on?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, actually, first, I wanted to add something which you told, like, listening to a discussion.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm also 2024.
[SPEAKER_03]: So something around your age.
[SPEAKER_03]: So harsh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold on a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're some you're in some place that's echoing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I want you to do is I want you to speak softer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's not as much echo is really hard to hear.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it better now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, be sure to just speak softer, and it'll be perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, so I was saying that comedy works better when there are two people.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have seen a few comedians.
[SPEAKER_04]: They are going to Omegle.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now, Omegle is not shut down, but there are a few sites where you can meet this stranger.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what they do is they will say some bad joke, and they will take the reaction, and then they will post it on TikTok, Instagram, Twitter, everywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's how they have built their audience.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now they are very famous, like it's millions of followers, and now they are getting booked.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if that is helpful, you can try that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you saying you use Omegle as my audience?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or just the reaction video, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Get somebody on FaceTime, tell them the joke.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when they cringe, just go, so I guess that one didn't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the funny reaction might be funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: that's a good tip
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you put it online, then you will have your audience also online.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that is just my suggestion as Andy is a better person.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you also know your field.
[SPEAKER_02]: We should start a podcast together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do it, set it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just the white man in the Indian.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: Your voice and my voice would have a great contrast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: You hit me up.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, look, I'm expanding my network, Andy.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Simple.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Andy, I am a tech consultant.
[SPEAKER_04]: I help non-technical founders to build their minimal viable product.
[SPEAKER_04]: And to get that done, I get that done within two weeks.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like, if you need something technical, AI, SAS,
[SPEAKER_04]: or AI agent or anything, and you are a non-technical person, then I will build that within two weeks for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I will charge that approx $4,000 to $5,000, which is like 50% of the amount what my competitors are doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So before, like right now, before two months, my all audience and all clients are inbound from X.
[SPEAKER_04]: So my post usually used to hit approx 100,000 impressions every day.
[SPEAKER_04]: But because of this new algorithm or something happened, now my posts are going like 500 impressions or something like that, not even crossing 1,000 impressions.
[SPEAKER_04]: So my inbound leads are getting lower.
[SPEAKER_04]: How can I fix that, if you can help me with that?
[SPEAKER_01]: So your impressions are getting lower from what for how long?
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, like at my peak time, I used to get a hundred thousand impression every day on the same account.
[SPEAKER_04]: And right now I'm getting just three to 400, uh, three to 400 depression.
[SPEAKER_04]: And from those impression, I used to get inbound clients for whom I was building that tech product.
[SPEAKER_04]: So right now my inbound leads are like just.
[SPEAKER_04]: five or 10 every month.
[SPEAKER_04]: Usually it was like five or 10 every day.
[SPEAKER_04]: And out of them, I would select the best one and I will go with them.
[SPEAKER_04]: But due to my impression is down, my leads are also down.
[SPEAKER_01]: How long ago was this?
[SPEAKER_04]: It started just last month.
[SPEAKER_04]: Before that, my impressions were great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: On this account or other accounts?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, the same account, same account.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you go down, uh, July or August one, like every post are hitting 10 to 15 K average.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, each day I have a one post that is hitting like a hundred thousand impression.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you, are you doing different things?
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there, first of all, uh, the world changes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two years ago, I used to get 75 to 100 inbound leads from my consulting company.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I get between 10 and 20.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't do anything different, except for the world changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: More AI, more this and that, the economy is going down.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's all kinds of reasons why it can happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the bottom line is, the audience chooses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I haven't looked at any of your stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know but It it always it always goes like this whenever there's a new technology every some early adopters want to get a part of it and That's about 10% of the market and then after the early adopters go do it they kind of prove it works a little bit then the
[SPEAKER_01]: what I call the alpha testers come in and they start doing stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: The early adopters will do it regardless if it works, it doesn't work, they'll try to get it to work, they'll mess with it, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: The alpha adopters will come in next, they're about 10%, and they'll go, if they say, wow,
[SPEAKER_01]: It really works.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then what happens is you get 50-60% of the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what typically happens is the Alpha people come in the 5-10%.
[SPEAKER_01]: They try it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them make it work.
[SPEAKER_01]: They go, this is really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the Alpha people come in and they're another 5-10%.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that gets to 10 or 18-20%,
[SPEAKER_01]: then you could have a cascading virality.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if it's five or 10%, and it's another five or 10%, and you get to 10, 12% of the market being interested in your thing, and it never goes past that 18, 19, 20, 30% of people who are, when they show up, they purchase and buy, then maybe it's not gonna work.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just kind of what I've seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I again, I don't know if that has anything to do with you or anything to do with what you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's kind of what's what I've seen in the past.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so I have posted a few of my viral work down the comment, you can check that out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Meanwhile, I also wanted to add that few of my competitors on x, try to copy my content like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I won't say copy, but try to do similar things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now they are getting the good impression, like what I used to get, but mine is down.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm not able to understand, like, that is okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like that is the algorithm thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is down right now that will get better next month or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm totally fine with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But can you tell me how I can acquire more client with some different approaches apart from ads?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to use ad right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: If anything don't work, then I might use it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But apart from this method, like I am posting on X and LinkedIn, apart from this, how can I get client in tech consulting?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember to speak softly so that the microphone works better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're a fisherman,
[SPEAKER_01]: You can take your boat and put it in the middle of the desert and take all your fishing equipment and put your bait on and throw it out into a dry lake and catch zero fish.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you can take your boat and all your fishing equipment and go where there are schools and schools and schools of fish swimming up and down a river and throw your fishing line in the river and catch a fish every minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you're fishing in the wrong place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think X and LinkedIn both are the right place, but what bait are you using?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you trying to capture and what value are you giving, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the world of marketing, sales, and all this stuff we're talking about, personal branding, it's about value.
[SPEAKER_01]: What value are you giving today so that people will be interested in listening to you tomorrow?
[SPEAKER_01]: paying for you to do services.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're doing Claude code and you're doing vibe coding results for AI automations and you're trying to sell it to people on X and LinkedIn by saying if you need something I can do it for you fast well
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody can just go to Claude and say, how do I do this?
[SPEAKER_01]: And Claude will tell them how to use their own Claude to make the tool you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to add value on something else that people can't do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or either something that they haven't done, they want done, and they don't want to spend the time learning it, or they don't want to spend the time it takes for them to get up to speed to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're decreasing the time it takes to get the result.
[SPEAKER_01]: or you're decreasing the effort it takes for them to get the result.
[SPEAKER_01]: So either I give you a result that's better, faster than you can do yourself, and I'm giving it to you better, faster than you can, if you spent all the time learning, that you would even be able to do eventually anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to do those two things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Increased likelihood of success, decreased time to completion.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like one of those two things is out of whack.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're still getting work, still getting hired, that's good.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like, what kind of content I should publish every day?
[SPEAKER_04]: And how many posts are fine?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or like, is there any other platform also that I should explore?
[SPEAKER_01]: Instagram and TikTok for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where most people are.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll give you an example about Netflix and YouTube and regular TV, cable TV.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you took all of the cable TV and all of the over-air broadcasting, roughly 60% of it is over the air and cable, okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: But Netflix is 8% of all streaming traffic on its own.
[SPEAKER_01]: Disney's about 10 to 12%.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the Netflix catalog is 36,000 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every movie, everything that you can watch, 36,000 hours total, okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: YouTube is 12 to 25% of all video consumption on every place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason it's crazy
[SPEAKER_01]: YouTube users are uploading more than 36,000 hours of video every three days.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bottom line, if you're going to be in the personal branding business, you need content and you need more of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you need to post it in more places.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so like, you want you advise me to post like three to five times every day with different content.
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends on the platform.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I did a research.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, for example, if you post more than four times a day on Tick Tock, the algorithm will suppress you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instagram is five posts a week, three stories per day.
[SPEAKER_01]: But before the algorithm starts to do something different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, here's the crazy thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you post 50 times a day, the algorithm doesn't necessarily penalize you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It penalizes you from what it would give you from virality from five posts a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can still post 50 posts a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them are going to hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Facebook, supposedly, two a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: LinkedIn, five posts a week, one a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: X, five posts a day before it starts to de-boost you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blog typically is seven posts a week, one a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Threads, the platform, three posts a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Truth Social, five points a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: WhatsApp, three updates a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Telegram, five updates a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spotify, two episodes a week for your podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: YouTube, four algorithm dependent videos a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's if you're doing like long form.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shorts, 10 to 15 a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Discord, seven posts or announcements per week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pinterest, 10 posts per day.
[SPEAKER_01]: School, seven posts a week before it starts to community disengagement or spammy reception.
[SPEAKER_01]: Reddit, five posts a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Snapchat, three stories a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Newsletter, three a month, four a month, one a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I know people who are making more money by they're literally sending a newsletter every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I don't know if all this, if this research is true or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do a webinar, you do three, one a week, Blue Sky, five posts a day, Red Note, which is a Chinese app, seven posts a week, one a day, Note Place, five a day, 1010, four messages a day, Be Real, one a day, and Substack, five notes a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the basic platforms that I watch and track.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I put, I check that report every month to see what the algorithms are constantly changing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you just repeat that for LinkedIn?
[SPEAKER_04]: I have heard five posts a week.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for Twitter, I heard five posts a day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_01]: According to my research, if you post more than five times a week,
[SPEAKER_01]: LinkedIn will give you a little bit of a will start to deboost you and think that you're doing a little spam.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, and it was a five post a day, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but I don't believe that's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are trying to get the maximum ROI.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, in other words, return on investment, the most amount of engagement per the least amount of work.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I really don't think it if you if you post
[SPEAKER_01]: Every hour, one post a day, excuse me, one post an hour, 24 hours a day, you post 24 posts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really think X decreases, delimits you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it will take the ones that have more engagement and it will move it further ahead in the For You page.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do think if you posted every single minute for the next 24 hours and you posted
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever it is, 86,000 times, which is the number of seconds there are in a day, 86,400, I think it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you post 86,000 posts, probably one a second, probably get banned.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's probably a limit somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the bottom line is, if you're looking for more
[SPEAKER_01]: engagement, you need to post content that's about engagement.
[SPEAKER_01]: So every, every post, if you're going to post for engagement, in other words, you want people to call you or DM you or whatever, then everything you should do is like, I've got this cool thing, let me show you how I did it.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way, if you want more, click here, send a DM, send me this word, send me whatever and then use, you know, one of the tools that you can get for, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: for DMs and other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are tools you can go buy for 10, $15 a month.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they'll auto respond to your DMs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I forget what it's called.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me look it up real quick.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, no, I have built those type of tools.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that is fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I was planning to give away some props.
[SPEAKER_01]: Moxo and ManyChat are the two tools that most people use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Moxo and ManyChat.
[SPEAKER_01]: ManyChat will connect with all of your DMs, and if somebody posts, like, you know, you've seen the thing, hey, post, you know, vicious, and I will respond with the latest cool thing, or send me a thing on, you know, branding, and I'll send you my link to your special, super special assessment tool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And ManyChat is the tool that they typically do with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I should do some kind of giveaways, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to build this level of quality, you should use this type of prompt.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have made the list of prompts.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just DM me, you will get it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or just put DM in chat, I will send you the DM.
[SPEAKER_04]: Something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's an exchange of value.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're giving them some value in exchange for their contact information.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's lots of ways to, I recommend you go get the $100 million Leeds book from Alex Ramosi.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the blue book.
[SPEAKER_01]: The purple one is offers, the blue one is Leeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: The blue book, Alex Ramosi's blue book, $100 million Leeds, read that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will show you and tell you how to
[SPEAKER_01]: outreach to other people to get more people to request or to make an offer to, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So leads are people who, they're unknown people who become known for whatever reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you give them an offer, that's part of the sales process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So marketing is taking people who don't know about you and telling them about you, and then they're interested.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sales is when you turn that interest into paying customers.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the sales process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I believe that everyone should enable their own personal branding.
[SPEAKER_01]: That should become a focus of their own life.
[SPEAKER_01]: That Amazon today announced that they're laying off 10 or 30,000 people today, tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I posted from the Warren tracker is a place in the United States if you have more than a hundred employees And you're gonna lay people off you have to give them you have to give 30 days notice And you must update the Warren tracker and so you update the Warren tracker and 30 days later.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can lay people off and if you go there it's There are you know just a ton of things that are on their way coming so I
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you read the $100 million offers book, basically, it sounds like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You connect with somebody and tell them about the thing that you're doing, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: For Melrose, I'm gonna do comedy.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you engage with me, you're gonna get funny chuckles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, you're gonna get the payoff is you get a laugh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Harsher, if they connect with you, they're gonna get a tool, an app, an AI automation workflow, whatever it is that you're delivering.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you do that and you deliver, then what will happen is the people who you're telling will tell more people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then word of mouth is more valuable than any other type of advertising because if I tell you and you tell your buddies and your buddies tell other people, you're going to tell people too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that just cascades into way more people than you can ever get by any other method.
[SPEAKER_01]: Understood And so go go start with the hundred million dollar leads book and look up or look up lead magnet led lead magnet and then what you want to do is create something of value so that everyone can get it and
[SPEAKER_01]: And when they get the thing of value, they, all they do is they give you your, then you get their email and you send it to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you take their email and you put it on an email list.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you have, now you have a customer list.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the, this is the basics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I, please learn from me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I screwed this up for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I did was I created a blog.
[SPEAKER_01]: I worked really hard on the, on the organic content and the organic content produced.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots and lots of people right now, 2.6 million people have gone to my blog and read something or clicked on something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I went about in February of 2024, there was 500,000 page views now 2.6 million in less than two years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I figured out how to do organic content.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people are interested in reading it thousand a day,
[SPEAKER_01]: 400 today, 5,000 tomorrow, 3,500 on Sunday, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: People read what they read.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when there's more interesting things, then I write more about the things that are interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's all I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just, if it works, I do more of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it doesn't work, I do less of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every week,
[SPEAKER_01]: at least one of my posts and one of the things I write, bombs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gets, you know, 5,000 people read today, 3,000 people read the next day, and the next day, 400.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that article sucked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody wanted that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: The algorithm didn't send it to anybody new, so that was a bad article.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me write some new stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just do that over and over again.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my super secret.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just do it every day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think it will help my audience?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because like, I'm targeting founders who are willing to pay average 5000 to $10,000 ticket to build their software as a service product or AI agent or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: So do you think TikTok
[SPEAKER_04]: might be have my audience because like, uh, I'm not sure about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I have seen people who are using TikTok, like, uh, they don't have some work and they are scrolling every day or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: How old are the founders?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the market of your, of the people who bought your stuff?
[SPEAKER_04]: So the youngest one was 25 and the older one was oldest one was 40.
[SPEAKER_04]: So between 25 to 40.
[SPEAKER_01]: So go to your favorite LLM and ask it, where do people who are 25 to 40 year olds who are doing this kind of job, where do they spend their time when they're browsing or when they're looking for something else?
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do market research, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gonna tell you they're on Instagram and TikTok, occasionally Facebook, WhatsApp, they're gonna tell you all the things that they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your job is to just put, you know, throw your hook where the fish are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Throw your bait where there's a lot of fish.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll get, you'll, you'll, you will catch way more fish than if you get all the perfect equipment and throw it out to a dry lake bed in the, in the desert.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's a dumb example.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I tell examples in a dumb way so that everybody goes, well, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, exactly, that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I know so many people who've decided to build a software product and then never tell anyone about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or they build a software product and they only try to get their mom to buy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to go where the fish are, find out what the fish want.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're a fisherman, you know the reason why you bring a big tackle box full of all kinds of bait is because some days, even if you have the best bait in the world, that yesterday they were catching everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, that bait, they go, oh, I don't want that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you always have to constantly change the bait to catch the fish.
[SPEAKER_01]: And whatever they're biting on today is what you serve.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, well, Harsh, thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time for us to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thank you, everybody, for joining.

[SPEAKER_01]: If any one person shows up, I will bring 100% of this every single day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate every one of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for joining.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, the world needs entrepreneurs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It needs, absolutely needs people to come up with and serve everybody else.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the world is a cold, dark place, so grab your torch, light it, go out into the dark world.
