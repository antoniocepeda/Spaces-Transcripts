[SPEAKER_00]: All right, good afternoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is 12 o'clock on the 27th of October and we're going to be talking about personal brand constraints.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a list of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go through those real quick so we get some folks on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a couple of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first constraint of a personal brand is time and resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got limited time and resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna have to build something.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna take some consistency.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna have delayed visibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what's gonna happen is you need to produce things consistently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Secondly, when you do the consistency part, you probably are gonna be inconsistent in your message.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the way, my personal brand Blueprint has kind of fixed and solved all of these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: with the three pillars, which is your voice, your audience, and your zone of genius, or your superpower, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The second thing, well, I already got the second one, inconsistency in messaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Third, you're gonna have to balance between your professionalism and your authenticity.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much of your cool, genuine stories, how much of your professionalism do you need to do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually recommend about
[SPEAKER_00]: 80% on target, especially at the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're building a personal brand, start there.
[SPEAKER_00]: 80% of your content needs to be on message, on point to your audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then 10% about this other additional kind of authenticity idea, and then 10% on if you're a brand ambassador for another brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, if you
[SPEAKER_00]: you are a full-time employee or you have your own company or you're building something and you're the Whatever you have some job title and you're building something else and you want your personal brand to be that something else You do the 80% on the something else 10% authentic you if you like, you know airplanes or Porsches or Corvettes or whatever you like golf tennis
[SPEAKER_00]: cooking, wine, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do 10% of that, 80% on point, and then 10% that, hey, by the way, I work for this other company and I do this job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you're gonna need to do, so that's authenticity versus professional balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you're gonna have to deal with this idea of differentiation versus oversaturation, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which, by the way, I don't believe in oversaturation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you need to hit your target.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to hit your audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to describe the problems they face So well that they know for sure you are the only guy that is gonna be a guy girl Whatever is the only person who's gonna be able to help them solve that Here's here's here's a big one a Constraint you sometimes we're self.
[SPEAKER_00]: We we're not aware of how we are right sometimes we need to be clear and sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We guess why the audience is listening.
[SPEAKER_00]: We guess what the strengths are.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't really ask.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you gotta ask and do things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last one is reputation, actually two more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reputation management versus criticism.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're doing this, you're doing this, you're doing this, somebody criticizes you and you go, oh man, do I pull back, do I add more, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a constraint on whether you add or
[SPEAKER_00]: continue with your personal brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the last one is it evolves, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We start doing one thing, we realize that people really want something slightly different, and so then we evolve.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you look over time, through anybody's personal brand, they always started with some idea to begin with, and then they evolve to who they are today, so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are all really important kind of distinctions and things that are constraints to your personal brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please notice, I did not say that your personal brand is limited to a platform or your personal brand is limited to an idea or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You pick your audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: You pick your platform.
[SPEAKER_00]: You pick what problems you want to solve.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the way, that's what I mean by superpower, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The problems you solve, you've already solved, you can prove you've solved them 100 times over, and then now you're gonna share them with the rest of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what we want to do, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you even look today, Cody Sanchez just put out a post that said, don't ever take advice from someone who hasn't done the thing they're trying to sell you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so that would be like me telling you about investments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I have some investments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, they've grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have they made me financially independent?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can't teach you that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bottom line, and don't take advice from me on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you want to say, create a personal brand, do it for an extended period of time, create a blog, generate millions of page views,
[SPEAKER_00]: Been there, done that, can show you how I did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can hopefully do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may not get the same results as me, but you can do the same activities.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do the activities, you'll get some results, whether they're as good or not, that's up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meaning it's up to you to pick your audience, to pick your targets, to pick the problems you're solving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because oftentimes we solve problems that we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: because we have that problem, so we solve the problem, and then we think other people probably gonna have that same problem and solve it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We go out looking for the other people to solve their problems, and they don't have the same problems that we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you have to look and work on how do you create that kind of message.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, that's what we're gonna talk about today.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a little setup while everybody's joining.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you all for joining.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gotta tell you,
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate every single day that there is more than just me talking on this space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you to each one of you, Janie and Harsh and Patricia and Antonio and Alex, I could go through all the rest of the names, but I appreciate everybody listening and I appreciate all of your absolute, you know, coming and asking your questions and talking about telling us stuff because there's a whole bunch of stuff that I don't know and and I
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see any hands yet, but I'm just going to call on Jim.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Jim.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, Andy.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I had to do this morning?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you guys in Canada do the same thing, but in the United States, citizens get called to do jury duty.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this morning, I went to do my civic duty.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I showed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they said, do you have any of these qualified?
[SPEAKER_00]: I go, yeah, I do this, I run my own company, and I basically work on billable hours, so it'd be a financial hardship for me to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the way, I know it drives you crazy, but it's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I'm at now, and we're moving towards the other way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I did that, and then I got excused, so woo-hoo, I did my civic duty, and then here we are back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in the saddle again, so that was my morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how about you, what's going on with you?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been called for jury duty, but I know the judge made a speech and about the importance of showing up for jury duty duty.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, thank you for your time and attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, and then the case didn't need a need to, didn't need to move forward for whatever reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they dismissed that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just spent the morning, uh, touring, uh, I guess the building.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty much it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, what are we talking about today?
[SPEAKER_01]: What does it mean by personal brand constraints?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you referring to?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the things that are keeping you from building a personal brand?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you start, what are the things you have to deal with?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the constraints?
[SPEAKER_00]: So time and resources, inconsistency of messaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you balance between your professional view and your authentic human self?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you differentiating yourself or you're oversaturating?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you aware of the problems you're solving or are you just talking about the stuff you want to solve?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then is there any trolls or misrepresentation?
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't be controlled.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you deal with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you deal with criticism?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if your brand evolves, you start with one thing and then you grow into the next thing and the next thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does that grow over time?
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are constraints because one of the primary methods to building a personal brand
[SPEAKER_00]: basically to hack the algorithm and that's on X or Instagram or tick-tock or Google or whatever your platform is Those algorithms all have some nuances to them But essentially they all reward time on platform and behavior and consistency so if you're consistent you spend time on the platform you post things and get other people to spend time on the platform and
[SPEAKER_00]: The algorithm is going to promote you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right now, it's more important to have the algorithm promote you than it is to have a big follower base.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because most people don't see all the things that they're followers or even all the things that they're following.
[SPEAKER_00]: They only see what's kind of fed to them in the For You pages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, that's what the ideas I have been working on this weekend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't know much about that, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: So most constraints I see is that people just don't make content.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, again, I make video content only.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if someone says they make video content, show me your TikTok, and I'll just see how much content they make.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, my Instagram literally says I've made 12,000 pieces of content.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my TikTok is probably 15,000 pieces of content.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if someone says, like, I make content on Instagram, I'm like, great, show me your Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have like 300 posts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, well, it's good that you started.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, like, what do you want to say?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I think I just posted in the community that I don't care about all those other metrics that people look at, like followers and page views and likes and reposts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, that's really quite irrelevant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, assuming you want to make money with social media.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if you're just there for fun, then yeah, you can follow any metric you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: game the algorithm to do more reposts or you can be a reply guy or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really care about the algorithm.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the only two metrics that matter is how many emails do you collect per day?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I want to know if someone's making money with social, I just need two questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many emails are you collecting in a day?
[SPEAKER_01]: They should know if they're making
[SPEAKER_01]: the top guys that are making money know how many emails are collected in a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when is the date of your next launch?
[SPEAKER_01]: All the top moneymakers and social media know when their launches, like what are they launching?
[SPEAKER_01]: When is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have them staggered out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you can't answer literally those two questions, I know the amount of money you're making is probably, you know, like lunch money, probably, or you're just doing it for fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's my sort of perspective on, on the metrics and the constraints.
[SPEAKER_01]: The constraint is most people,
[SPEAKER_01]: don't collect emails, they don't know when their launch is, and I guess they don't make content.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well that's...
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you reverse that around and you say, if you make significant content with a call to action to collect an email, and you do that consistently enough, you'll collect emails, and then you can use those collection of emails
[SPEAKER_00]: to launch your next whatever product, service, whatever you want them to buy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's a pretty straightforward path to monetize social media.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has nothing to do with the algorithm.
[SPEAKER_01]: The algorithm is just
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even pay attention to the algorithm.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really don't, how many followers I get.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use it maybe for social proof when I use my copy, when I write my copy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really, all you need to know if you want to make money is how many pieces of content are you making a day?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that lead to emails?
[SPEAKER_01]: How many of those are you collecting a day?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you're collecting that many a day, when's the date of your launch?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if they're like, oh, I collect 10 emails a day, when's your launch?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I know they're not going to make anything because you're not launching anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how are you going to make any money?
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent Just solid advice, you know everybody needs to go back and listen to the first 10 minutes or at least from 1205 to 1213 when Jim started talking that because that's gold and by the way That's the formula if you want to make money just do what Jim does in fact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's what I suggest follow Jim and
[SPEAKER_00]: turn on notifications, go on Instagram and TikTok, follow him there, watch everything he does, and then do your version of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the way, Jim, it's okay if they totally steal your content, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's no such thing as oversaturation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there's only one you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So only you will be able to say it the way you say it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it doesn't really matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's like a million people doing health and wellness and personal finance and whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they all just spin it their own way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so steal my content.
[SPEAKER_00]: Steal Jim's content.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know Gary V basically says as an open thing, take everything he does.
[SPEAKER_00]: copy it, do your own version of it, and go ahead and post it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the answer is if you just, if you post more, you'll get more content.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I proved that on my blog as just because I didn't know what was going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started posting twice a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I started posting once a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I started posting twice a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought, huh, what happens if I post five or six times a day?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot more traffic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even the, the, I mean, that's pretty much it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sort of like, if you want to get good at a sport, you just put the reps in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how all you have to do to get better.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: Gary V, Brunson, Cardone, everyone on social media that's making money, they know exactly how many emails they collect per day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they know exactly when they're like, I was watching Cardone this Saturday, because I think he's live every Saturday.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember what time, but I just happened to catch him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, you know, he's educating.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you're supposed to be educating on your content.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, um, if you're not educating, like if I look at your content and there's no education, probably not going to get that many emails, you know, you, because why would someone subscribe?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like your free content doesn't teach me anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why would your email teach me anything?
[SPEAKER_01]: So.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cardone's educating right and then near the end he starts pitching and I was like, there you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the launch He already has a launch date in his mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can you can see all of them are doing the same thing identical You just copy it Yeah, and you end up there's a book Jeff Walker's launch formula.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's just called launch, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's just called launch you have launch and product launch formula I think product launch formula was his first launch was his second and you can also read any of Brunson's stuff Which is like graphic secrets or whatever dot-com secrets.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all the same stuff really so it's all the same here, right and if you want to get if you have a superpower of something that you've done that you have proof that you have successfully completed and
[SPEAKER_00]: tell people about it, tell them how to how to get on your email list, and then get more and more and more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, you don't you don't need to do anything for money, like you can be on social media.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you don't know how many emails you collect per day, and you don't know when your launches, you'll make no money, which is not like the end of the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because maybe you just want to be on social media for fun, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people just don't really care about making money on social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: True.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, well, this is so it's been a year now that I've been doing spaces and I did it to start with not to make money but just to As an experiment does it work?
[SPEAKER_00]: Will people follow me?
[SPEAKER_00]: Will they join the space?
[SPEAKER_00]: Will they listen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Will they contribute?
[SPEAKER_00]: Will they give me you know information?
[SPEAKER_00]: Will they share what we have a conversation about?
[SPEAKER_00]: answer is yes people keep showing up and I'm extremely grateful for people showing up so I have some people to talk to and it's not just me talking blah blah blah by myself on these spaces but I do appreciate that I am trying to give value and then
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm pivoting to doing the same thing right creating more content Asking for emails putting people on my list.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm consolidating all of my channels into one and I have one product I'm Launching which is what I call the brand blueprint engine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you build your brand blueprint which is your voice your audience your superpower and then you turn that
[SPEAKER_00]: into content and then you can, I created a content generation creation seed system where I never run out of ideas, I never run out of things to talk about and then I have this super awesome cool editing machine so whatever I talk about I run it through that and it produces better content than I do myself and that's what you guys end up seeing and reading on my posts all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your social media should just show how to use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then people will go on your email list just to find out more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just show people why it's important, what problem it's solved, how you use it, the whole bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just gatekeep nothing, show everything, and the email list will just explode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I'm here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we talk about personal brand every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk about every one of the perspectives of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything's we talk about is on my seed file list and either it's today or tomorrow or next week's content.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I use these spaces, let's just be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use these spaces to make sure that the content I'm producing matches what you guys are asking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you ask for something, I go back and I revise my seed file list and I write content about it and then I use my cool editing tool
[SPEAKER_00]: to make it better and then I post it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can produce just massive amounts of content.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can run five channels of content daily and run my full-time company and do multiple projects in my full company and do all the proposals and do all of the meetings all at the same time without losing sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I solved it because I needed the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had the problem of, damn, I want to write this more stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much, how do I do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, how do I, okay, that's kind of good.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I make it better?
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, so I solved my own problem and fixed it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, let's go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Jim.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go to Patricia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, Patricia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for being so patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you today?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm doing well and I will be as patient as it takes when I get to listen to you and Jim because I'm just sitting here soaking it all in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all recorded so you can go back and record them again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and by the way, shortly, I don't know when I say shortly, that could be in an hour, a day, a week, or a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so shortly to me means it's on the list of things to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna take each one of these spaces turn it into a podcast And then when I start doing that I'll be telling you hey if you don't want to be on a podcast right this is recorded So if you want to be recorded once it's recorded.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna be put somewhere if you don't you're not then Don't grab the mic don't speak don't talk, but we're gonna.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna roll this stuff out anyway Thanks for the warning
[SPEAKER_04]: Not that it bothers me.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, anyhow, when it comes to brand constraints, and you said, you know, one of those was when you have a brand and then you go from one thing to the next to the next and let it evolve, how does that work and how does that constrain you?
[SPEAKER_04]: For me, back when I first started with the petite fashion stuff, I was totally zoned in on the fashion, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And everybody knew they could come to me, they could find the petite options, everything would be fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: The day Catherine was going to do the Remembrance Sunday event for Veterans Day, basically, for those of us here in the U.S., and everybody was like, oh my God, what's she going to wear?
[SPEAKER_04]: What's she going to wear?
[SPEAKER_04]: I automatically knew it's going to be something black because that's standard.
[SPEAKER_04]: But also I wanted attention to me on the vets.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that day, I made a hard shift.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, I am not reporting on outfits today.
[SPEAKER_04]: I will report on event.
[SPEAKER_04]: I will report on charity.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can get the outfit tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then people knew that from then on, they quickly discovered I was going to focus more on the charities.
[SPEAKER_04]: And those who didn't want to do that, they fell off.
[SPEAKER_04]: The rest of them stuck with me.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's why I'm still here 14 years later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: The point I was trying to make is, you know, Patricia, next week you may decide you want to talk only about cakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then from now on, you're just gonna talk about cakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The challenge is, you know, the kind of shiny object syndrome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ooh, cake today, earrings tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ooh, look at the tiaras the next day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ooh, and you know, if you say, oh, it's all about royal fashion, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: All goes in, it's all part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you just talk about, I don't know, you take,
[SPEAKER_00]: fall leaves and you put them in some kind of thing so that they become earrings and that's all you talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: You talk about the the leaves from here and the leaves from there and then all of a sudden it's wintertime and you have nothing to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah okay fine but what what
[SPEAKER_00]: My, the way that I build the blueprint, it is your voice plus your audience, plus the things that you have done in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the way, it can totally be three or four things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have to be one single individual thing, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I, I talk about athletics and all of the things it takes to be a champion that way, in reference of teamwork.
[SPEAKER_00]: and building some kind of leadership authority, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at everything I've talked about, it's all about how do you establish yourself as an authority, as a leader in something, everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You wanna be a leader in athletics, you wanna be a leader on a team, you wanna be a leader in business, you wanna be a leader in the church, you wanna be a leader in your family, you're gonna be a leader in your community.
[SPEAKER_00]: fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's to me, it's about leadership.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the problem is that leadership is a big problem and most people who are stuck
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I love helping the underdog who's stuck and want to move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not the everyone who feels stuck, but somebody who's like, I've tried these seven things and it doesn't happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, by the way, this is what's in my DMs.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my DMs it sounds like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried this and it didn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried this other thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what do you think I should do next?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's what you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: X, Y, Z.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, Oh yeah, that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, proof of concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then next person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I've tried this and I want to do this thing and I've tried.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, when you are doing things, and you just need the next refinement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can think of coaching, quote unquote, coaching
[SPEAKER_00]: in in the following steps there's the trainer that tells you you need to do a hundred push-ups and and run three miles and when you're done come back that's the trainer level to get you to the base
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after that, there's the coach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, now after you can run and you can do all the pushups or whatever it is, you can write all the content and you can create the videos, you can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next step is the coach who says, do more of this one, less of that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the quote unquote coach.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's the trainer says, do 100 of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the coach says, okay, you see these three, they were better than the other 97, do more of those three and here's why.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's some details to think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you start to, when 97 of them are good instead of three of them, you need the next level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the next level is called a mentor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the way, this is my structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody else has different words around it, but this is the way I do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mentorship is when the mentor asks you, okay, what do you wanna do with it?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you wanna get there?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you gonna use it for?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you build that into something different?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why did you do these ones and not other ones?
[SPEAKER_00]: They ask you questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So trainers tell you how many to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coaches tell you which ones do better than the other ones and do more of these or that or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And mentors ask you, why are you doing them at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is your purpose?
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you going to get there?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the objective?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you didn't do any of them and you did this other thing, would that produce the results you want?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what a mentor is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people use them as coaches, trainers, mentors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They kind of mix them all together.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my definition of them, because it's easier for me to remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trainers make you run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coaches tell you what to do after you can run.
[SPEAKER_00]: And mentors ask you, what game are you actually playing and how do you win?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the way that I look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the way I was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the mentors and coaches and trainers that I've had.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've had at every level, in every way, in every sport, in every activity I've done, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have coaches for
[SPEAKER_00]: Content I have coaches that have trained me on how to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had coaches on trained me how to do not Keynote speeches and then I have different people who've taught me how to do presentations and I have other mentors and coaches that have taught me how to manage meetings and Facilitate discussions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean I literally have paid for Coaching in every one of these areas over my lifetime
[SPEAKER_00]: And I still have contact with most of the people, a couple of them have passed away, but most of the people who have been my coaches and mentors are still available, and we still talk pretty frequently, at least every few quarters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, so, Patricia, if you're gonna pivot, or you're going to evolve, there's no problem with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But remember that there's a difference between evolving your brand into something else, and just
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about more and other cool stuff, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I'm talking about model airplanes, and tomorrow I'm talking about rockets, and then the next day I'm talking about hydration, and then the next day I'm talking about supplements, and then the next day I'm talking about pushups.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's gotta be cohesive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your audience will go, what are you talking, okay, you're not a reliable person, you're talking about 25 things, anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's that's something to think about.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I still keep it all royal centric.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just that now instead of just the fashion, I let them know what's going on at the event that they're peeking in on.
[SPEAKER_04]: And letting them find ways to get more involved.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a good formula for me so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, do you, do you have any other questions?
[SPEAKER_04]: Not at the moment.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm glad you got out of jury duty so quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, me too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm grateful for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went, I did my civic duty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I showed up, uh, I got excused and then now I'm, I'm done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I got summons the other week and we were able to provide documentation to the judge that basically said it would be a hardship on myself and family because I have to have somebody with me the whole time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, that was always fun figuring out how that worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's go to Noah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Noah, haven't talked to you for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been watching your amazing LinkedIn the last few months or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very happy for you and all the crazy things that are going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So congrats on that to start with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, things are going up in the rise.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's nothing to say apart from positivity.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, you know, you're talking about personal brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's beyond critical, you know, I wouldn't get many, any of my job offers or opportunities if it wasn't for personal branding.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I started building my personal brand at least a year, two years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think, I think that, uh, I think, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's my observation that personal branding was always important and then
[SPEAKER_00]: when COVID hit and everyone was not in face to face anymore for whatever period of time that was, whether some places were more than others, all of a sudden your digital presence became amplified.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, and now I think like, I'm sorry, I'm on my phone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought I unmuted myself and I said, yeah, it's been a while, but on X basis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I completely agree with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think the most important thing is starting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's the classic situation of, well, how do you measure personal branding?
[SPEAKER_02]: But more importantly, how do you measure all these marketing events and stuff you do?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the most important thing you need to do is go out of your comfort.
[SPEAKER_02]: I personally think we're at a point now more than ever that all of this business and all the opportunities, particularly in the AI space,
[SPEAKER_02]: happening at events.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's not happening anymore online but that's my sentiment of what's going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think everyone kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: is probably now who wants to adopt all this technology is at the similar level playing field of having had consumed enough information online and so i feel like the type of client base and businesses that are gonna take on business or work with you definitely are these events because now they're at the next stage because they're looking for people who have positions of authority.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, the well, okay, so two, two major things happened with COVID.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one is that businesses were able to refocus or forced to refocus their efforts from in person to online.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the second thing is, more people were, they, you know, the both the businesses and the consumers both went, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, we're gonna have to go online now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because of that, I mean, just look at the difference in the Amazon stock price from before COVID and after COVID.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They started to totally jump into the delivery method.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it was right before that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then bam, now, now who can compete with Amazon?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they're way out ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you're right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_02]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think also for me, you know, I was before chasing, you know, three to 5,000 pound projects.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I'm chasing, now I don't even need to chase anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: People come to me, like I woke up this morning and I, and it's Monday morning, you know, I had two leads that just came in inbound.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't do any outreach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I made a presentation last week about for, for a,
[SPEAKER_00]: four year project for about a million dollars and it was all about what they see when they engage my firm, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: When they engage me to do work and my company and my team, what do they get?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was all about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still haven't heard back from him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it was like Wednesday or Thursday, but So I expect you know a couple more days and then we'll get an answer back but the the interesting part was They had one idea and when I explained to them what that actually meant and what?
[SPEAKER_00]: What when I described their objective and said it seems like you want to get this kind of answer Yes, that's exactly what we want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, if you go about it this way, these are the constraints These are the things are gonna get in the way Here's a different way of looking at it You can get this but you end up with the same answer but this way you get the information like instantly and they were like, oh, I never thought of that but
[SPEAKER_00]: And essentially, instead of saying, you're going to create a portfolio project team, that's in charge of watching and tracking all of the individual projects, kind of like a mini PMO.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead, I said, why don't you just hire a coach?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and then say, the coach's job is to work with you on every single one of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: So really interesting inside that is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So last week, I want to say I had a presentation where I had over 90 people that were in the crowd and I was presenting in London.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a really good event, enterprise companies and everything was going well.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the next morning I had a scoping call with the company.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the scoping call with the company that they actually before the scoping for sent me a scope, a proposal from another development agency about how they would work on this Salesforce built in migration project basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so because, you know, I just finished this event the night before, this is how personal branding is key.
[SPEAKER_02]: I send them a few pictures of me being at this event and everything because it was Australia's first thing in the morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I jumped on my virtual call in the morning, you know, really tired after a long night of the night before this public speaking gig.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just started listening, asking you questions and I said to them, look, I'm going to be really straight up with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your Australian conversion rate is brutal.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the reality is you're talking about a Salesforce project.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's Salesforce, you know, I'm not going to get out of bed unless there's minimum starting £20,000.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then immediately I just set the level playing field.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, look, what I'll give you is free advice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll say, this is what you should do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is what you can and cannot do.
[SPEAKER_02]: But going forward, I really believe based on what you've already shared with me of another development, another developer was going to quote you and price you for this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just said to them, all three stakeholders on the call, I was like, look, you guys know more than anyone else.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do it yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want, you can quote me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can quote you for consulting, but I don't really think you're at a position where you even have the budget to hire me full time for this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it goes to exactly what you're talking about, the coaching element.
[SPEAKER_02]: Telling clients that it's okay that they don't have the money to hire me full time, but it's also better if they do it themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you just charge an hour or two and you're still making really good money from that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they respect your time when they realize that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, one of the things that I've done over my
[SPEAKER_00]: career is that I try to adopt this strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The strategy is you need
[SPEAKER_00]: You, Mr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Client, Mr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Client, you have all of the right ingredients, but you're probably not putting them together in the right order, and you're probably not putting them together in the right amounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So therefore, to use a dumb cake analogy, you've got all the stuff to make the cake, but your cake keeps coming out like crap.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's burnt, it's doughy in the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to put the right amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, you put the ingredients in the right order so the right sequence happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, once you have the right sequence, you have to do the right amounts of each one of the things so that you produce the result you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it always starts with the result you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I try to do is,
[SPEAKER_00]: I can come in and show you how to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can build a process for you to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can train everyone on how to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can build a standard operating procedure on what you need to actually do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I will teach and train and watch and let everybody take over and do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And eventually you won't need me to do that hands-on transformation because your team will be able to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at the end of it, they get the result they want.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get a team that's trained.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get procedures that they can fall back on, that they can incorporate new people into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the bottom line is you have adjusted the culture in order to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And adjusting the culture is the most challenging part, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, change management.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I say when I'm speaking to a client, you know, I always do the litmus test with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I say to them, look, listen, we can build what you're talking about and we could solve your problems and we can make sure instead of you guys spending hours or weeks on these tasks, we can automate it all.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it's a 30, 60 second solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know, the reality is you need to accept that we need one single point of contact and that single point of contact, when we ask you for a decision making, it needs to be a yes or a no immediately.
[SPEAKER_02]: We cannot move forward to the next gateways of the project.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always make it clear to them when I say look it's gonna take us at least starting off two weeks to really map out the current change process to make sure that what we build does not impact any change management of any of the stuff because.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is absolutely, and I say to them, we need to treat this like heart surgery.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't want to be in a situation where we build something, and then you have to then go and train all these people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they get all moody, and they go, oh, it's another thing that the management are forcing us to use or do.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, well, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we do the opposite, and we make it feel like there was no process, and it's the least amount of steps possible, and it almost feels like nothing has happened,
[SPEAKER_02]: then there is no pushback at the end when there's adoption.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because for us, what's critical is adoption nowadays, Andy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, it's not anymore, you know, we're not in a position anymore to try and get these quick wins or projects here and there where we want.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to play long-term plays where adoption is critical.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, how long, you know, was the project that we built adopted in a company?
[SPEAKER_02]: What was, you know, the details?
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, that's what's most important of a success factor anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because then they keep coming back for more and more work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the and the brilliance of what you're doing is that as soon as you solve the first problem, then they can imagine that pain has gone away.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the next pain?
[SPEAKER_00]: And as soon as they because the pain of
[SPEAKER_00]: Frustration of business never never fully goes away ever what happens is you just you you solve the big problem and then you have littler problems and then you just keep so there's always something to solve because
[SPEAKER_00]: Humans are constantly evolving and changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tastes are constantly evolving and changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Market environments and constraints are constantly changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if in 2020, in January of 2020, if I would have said, here's what's gonna happen, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: In the next three months, the world is gonna pivot and change, and it's going to disrupt pretty much every part of humanity for the next five years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, and by the way, it's gonna happen almost immediately within like a 30 to 60 day window.
[SPEAKER_00]: The entire business orchestration structure of how everything operates, gone and will be replaced by something new.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I would have told you that, people would have said, yeah, I don't believe you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, fine, whether it's true or not, but what actually happened is,
[SPEAKER_00]: is it has fundamentally changed business operations forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's what I mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Banking is based on cash flow of loans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cash flow of loans primarily are for the following.
[SPEAKER_00]: Buildings, land, business,
[SPEAKER_00]: Vehicles and consumer goods.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it Okay and so if you if you change the fact that now commercial real estate doesn't need to be commercial because instead of five days a week were there that was your Little think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably spent more time driving working in a place and driving home than you did awake at your home and
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now we have our largest expense is our home, second largest expense is taxes, third largest expense is our vehicle, and we're using those things so that we can sleep and get ready and then go to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that meant some large percentage of the money is allocated for use and funding of commercial real estate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Offices, this office and retail space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So COVID hit, office is a retail space, that whole market shrunk instantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the bank can't absorb that, they have 30 year loans.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we have this hybrid model.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of you who are listening, for the few who are left, the reason that we have hybrid work isn't because working remote doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because nobody wants to go back to five days a week, but the companies already have a whole bunch of loans.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we totally just walk, if we walk away from the commercial real estate, every single economy in the world goes upside down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Collapses because it's all built on debt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've hit the nail on the head with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the thing is we're, we're just outliers, aren't we?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, companies call us in, ask us to do some things, and then we have to go and witness and watch these poor souls flowing into the office.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I recently had to speak to a headhunter about, I want to say, a couple of months ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if I told you, Andy, but I won a Cloudflare hackathon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I saw the post.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I finished at the hackathon in less than 10 minutes, 15 minutes, actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was the first one to finish.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a two, 2.5 hour hackathon and I finished in 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just sat there and then the host of the cloud fed people were like, do you want to, and then the other startup was like, do you want to help out now and help us facilitate the event?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you finished.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's brilliant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I'm talking about that specific use case was after that, I got so much pushback and feedback from loads of different people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then a DM appeared from the headhunter who was actually from the company who was there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the headhunter was like, I'd like to have a meeting with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he spoke to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was like, look, I've got a couple of jobs that I think would be a great fit for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, OK, that's exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, but I've only just took on this new agency work I've started.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're paying me quite well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's completely remote.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was like, yeah, I can't match that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, well, what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: He was like, well, currently every single job in the tech world right now, and it's very competitive, is looking at three days a week minimum.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he also is in London.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he goes, oh, and on top of that, it's 996 culture in the startups right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you heard of the 996 culture?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's from China, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's nine hours a day, six days a week.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nine a.m. to nine p.m., six days a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's right, yeah, 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we used to call that halftime.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to make a joke about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's how the joke went.
[SPEAKER_00]: The joke was like, oh, you wanna build a startup, or you wanna work for Microsoft, or you wanna work in one of the fan companies, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Facebook, Amazon, F-A-N-G, Netflix, Google.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can work halftime, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can work any 12 hours you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: 9am to 9pm, six days a week, 12 hours a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know what, if you if you run a startup, that's what you do anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you I mean, I exactly I have my own company and I work 12 hours a day every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So exactly I don't I've never The there there are three things about conventional business and conventional education that I That I don't understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the three things.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one is the concept of retirement make a bunch of money put some away so that you can quit working and then whatever retire and the
[SPEAKER_00]: You can retire anytime you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put between 5 and 10 million dollars in the bank at any 60 to 80 percent return, you'll make 30 to 70 thousand dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you put 5 to 10 million pounds in the bank, you'll make 30 to 70 thousand pounds a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people can live on 30 to 70 thousand pounds a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you have to get the first 10 million to put in the bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, so you can retire anytime you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every other way is just a fancier way of saying, divert some money here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, the second thing is work-life balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't believe in work-life balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that there is life, and sometimes you work, and sometimes you enjoy the rest of your life.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you just, you have life, and sometimes you have to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're building something new, I don't believe in it either.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's always, I don't believe in it completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the, uh, so if I mentioned the, the hourglass.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, hourglass financing, that's what this means, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Retirement is like taking all the money you make, instead of filling an hourglass, you divert some of it over to this other hourglass, and when you decide to retire, you just cap that hourglass, flip it over, and hope you die before it runs out of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a stupid way to use your money.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is literally the stupidest way to use your money.
[SPEAKER_00]: A better way to do it would be to take all of that money, put it into something that produces cash flow, live off of that cash flow, and then when you die, whoever, and there's lots of ways, methods to do this, but the point is that that cash flow doesn't end when you die, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Rockefeller is gone, but the Rockefeller family is still making money off the money he made when he was back in the,
[SPEAKER_00]: nineteen hundreds eighteen nineties because he didn't he didn't just take the money put it into an account draining account go to zero he took all the money put into other vehicles of investment that produce the thirty to seventy thousand pound the dumb example is using it produces that kind of content that kind of offshoot of cash flow every month and and then as long as you don't destroy the
[SPEAKER_00]: the proverbial goose that lays the golden eggs, you still get the golden eggs forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, that's a much better way of thinking.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd say the issue you're mentioning here about all of this, Andy, is, you know, the generation like me, who's, um, you know, the, um, what's it called?
[SPEAKER_02]: Generation X, generation Z, everything that's basically post 1990s.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, at being born for us, retirement's not an option anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'll be completely transparent with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not even a thing because we have student loans debt.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have cost the average property household cost to even get on the property ladder.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like there's so many things that are against us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the other part about all of it is the job security.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, the ones that are generations even below me, you know, the ones that are like 25, 26 now, even 22, like you should see them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're happy to just work.
[SPEAKER_02]: in a coffee shop.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just in just like literally not even or not even work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like so because the whole work ethic is gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: The concept of work and work and having to work and build up your career that's gone for that entire generation here in the UK.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know about the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it well, it's desire my so my my daughter is 26 and my son is 22.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I totally understand that
[SPEAKER_00]: demographic, I mean, I don't understand them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have children who talk to me about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I understand I get to watch them go through their choices in life.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, you're, you're exactly right.
[SPEAKER_02]: The, the challenge houses don't cost us $50,000 houses don't cost us $80,000.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the average mortgage in the UK is, is, you know, half a million.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, where are you going to get half a million from after your student loans that is, you know, up to a hundred thousand dollars.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, and then there's a situation of getting a job.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then once you get a job, it's like, you have to be doing nine to five.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, I think it just breaks down to one simple thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, you know, um, the world, I feel it may sound really harsh, but I'm just going to say it anyways, people aren't dying anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you know, actually, so, you know, it's because of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know what else?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like the resources and everything is concentrated to only a certain amount of people in a specific demographic of age group over, you know, over, over 50.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, here's, here's even more ironic thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is, it's not that they're not dying anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: but they're not quitting and walking away selling their house and retiring.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what happened is all of the boomers are still working, even though lots of businesses are going out of business people are finishing their quitting or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: The point is, the shift has already happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are 70 year old people who are still
[SPEAKER_00]: the presidents of companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the past, they would have been shuffled out and there would be a new buck in there, a 50-year-old person.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the old buck would have left, sold their big house, moved to the retirement area, wherever that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know in the UK where it is, but in the United States, it's like Florida, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So they would have moved to Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just not happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so because it's not happening, I think it's happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's happening, but not at a scale that it should be happening because of modern medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because of the grind, you know, they're addicted to realize that, you know, they have the tremendous amount of resources and wealth concentrated for a specific age group.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know and and as a result it makes it very hard to convince that person you know who.
[SPEAKER_02]: Enjoy is this fair i mean it's a valid point you would love doing that if you work so hard and you everyday you wake up and you get to enjoy you know telling people what to do and enjoy literally running something that you started from nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's like that has caused a massive chain reaction to a point where anyone who's aged between, I want to say 20 to 25, 27, they're just like, what's the point?
[SPEAKER_02]: Why are we even going to work?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the point?
[SPEAKER_02]: Please explain to me what's the point in me working on my career ladder if I will never get to that level?
[SPEAKER_02]: And they raise a valid point.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the only thing they've got going for them is the whole startup ecosystem and software development.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's where I feel you are actually applauded and you are commended for that youth and that young age.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, anyone over the age of 40, it's impossible for you to get a job in the software world anymore in big tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seriously.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't even look at your CV.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the development and engineering side, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the management?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that's what I mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I work as a project manager, program manager.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get work all the time still.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm an old guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but I'm not talking about Andy, you're in a, I'm saying I'm being more generalist approach, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So like I'm saying opportunity for those young people still is in software development and the tech world, you know, the grunt work, which is the really hard, hard thinking and a lot of killing your hours and killing yourself so many hours in the middle of the night to figure these problems out because of the burnout risk.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's, there is that, you could almost say like, uh, uh, light at the end of the tunnel because you can be paid really, really well to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but other industries it's not, it's the opposite happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, these people are not retiring.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're still doing their jobs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I've reached out to some of my old friends in enterprise sales and I'm like, Oh, we're still here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're still plodding along.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're still doing the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, but it's been, you know, in the space of me going independent,
[SPEAKER_02]: In the last, I want to say almost two years, what I've achieved in the last two years is probably more than what I've achieved in six months when I was in enterprise sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I, I understand that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, when I was, so I used to say that I was a reluctant founder.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason I said that was because I, I.
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted Okay, I grew up where they taught you get a good education get a good degree get a good job make your money pay off your house pay off your mortgage and then blah blah right and that the challenge for me was about halfway through the world changed and there was we talked about another time, but And teeny thank you so much for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been here like the beginning holding your hand up and
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me just make this last point and then we'll go to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was forced to just get contracts to pay for my home and family and everything else instead of getting a full-time job.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they said, well, we don't want to hire you for a full-time job, but we have this two-year contract.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you like to do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, what are you going to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to say, no, I'm going to not, I'm going to turn down twice as much money as I was making before so that I can get something with security.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, you know, if they pay me twice as much money, I could pay for whatever security you imagine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, there's no such thing as security.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the other thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the first thing I learned.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no such thing as job security.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the biggest load of nonsense.
[SPEAKER_02]: As soon as you have a salary job, as soon as you're in there, you know, especially a big company, more than anything, security is completely the opposite because you've got to, when you start, you've got to prove yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then once you've proven yourself, you get comfortable and you know what to do and how to manage the whole politics internally there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you can just play, skate through the whole job.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um,
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other thing is, the business owners will never give you a piece of the business.
[SPEAKER_02]: Never.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless you're in the startup world.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where basically all the normal rules of business and conventional business is thrown out the window.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call that the wild west.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, let's go to Teenie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, Teenie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think we've met before, but thank you for being so patient.
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been here since the beginning of this space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, my goodness.
[SPEAKER_03]: And honestly, I've had my hands up the entire time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can tell you for a fact that, well, first I'm spacing with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I, Andy, it's a very interesting space.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, I learned a lot and I'm sure I'm going to be coming more often.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, hi everyone else.
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of along the way lost my train of thought.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did take a few notes.
[SPEAKER_03]: A couple of people I wanted to ask questions, they left, but I'm going to try.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, do you have a question?
[SPEAKER_00]: We normally end right about now, but what's your question?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a question?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been over an hour.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said, I lost my train of thought and some of the questions I wanted to ask, I kind of learned.
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone was speaking earlier.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to ask a question, but he left.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a cool thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So next time, put your questions in the purple pill.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll answer them along the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Secondly, if you have any questions, just send me a DM or whatever and we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll figure it out if you think about it later or tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I, I did take a note.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did take a couple of notes to be honest, but, um, I mean, the people I wanted to talk to, they left, but I could ask you a few.
[SPEAKER_03]: If, um, because I have to go back tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, that's fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it was nice joining your space.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a good one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for the space.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been a while since I came on the space.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been too busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm so happy for you that you're busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I hope that everybody understands if you guys win, I'm going to celebrate it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's very, very important that you have somebody who's in your corner all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope
[SPEAKER_00]: that I can be that for you, for anyone who listens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, thank you all for coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The world needs you right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are people on their hands and knees begging, praying to God for the answers that you already have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't start your business, and if you don't start creating and giving people these offers and giving them the ability to connect with you,
[SPEAKER_00]: their prayers aren't going to be answered.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why you should take your torch, light it, and carry the warm, bright torch out into the dark, cold world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk to you guys tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take care.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again, Noah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye bye.
