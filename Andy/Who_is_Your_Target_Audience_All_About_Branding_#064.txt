[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, i'm excited about today today is november 6th.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a very very cool day Uh, we have all kinds of amazing things to talk about today.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we're going to talk about today is going to be how Do you find your target?
[SPEAKER_02]: We talked about your superpower yesterday.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey mayor.
[SPEAKER_02]: We talked about your superpower yesterday We talked about how do you define your voice a few days ago and today we're going to talk about
[SPEAKER_02]: Who is your target audience?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm fired up to talk about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Melrose, what's going on?
[SPEAKER_02]: My favorite disabled comedian is happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: I changed my profile pic again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah?
[SPEAKER_02]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you like this one better or should I go back to the coin?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like all of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it really matters who are you and what you're trying to do, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you want to be successful, I mean, if you want to be recognized time over time over time, you need to have kind of the same kind of look and the same kind of feel and that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Consistency really matters in the branding kind of world, but well,
[SPEAKER_02]: Pick one and move on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean Ronnie Dangerfield always wore a suit with a white shirt and a red tie Always pulled it to the side and always talked about you know how he gets no respect That was his whole brand Yeah, I was like his in-between he'd use that this set up every joke Yeah, it's still the brook but the me for years
[SPEAKER_02]: But the brand was, his brand was, he gets no respect, he makes fun of himself and everybody around him, he points out everything bad that's going on in his life, and he always wore a suit with a white shirt and a red tie when he was performing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now on movies he was a character, but ever see him ever on Johnny Carson or anywhere else without a blue suit, white shirt, and a red tie?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my whole point is the visual is just as much the brand as the sound, as the message, as the tone, as the presentation, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually agree with you.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I know a lot of comedians who wear the same like polo shirt every single night they do comedy.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they become like recognizable and oh, it's the guy in the yellow polo shirt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't do that, but I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well,
[SPEAKER_02]: You might want to consider it because the reason they do it because it works right think think about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: What color is IBM?
[SPEAKER_02]: Blue, what color is McDonald's?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yellow and red, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay there that way what color is Ferrari cars a Ferrari is a is red car, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay racing Fords are what color?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well red is like a naturally like for humans.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's like our favorite color
[SPEAKER_02]: It is it's the one that attracts the most attention absolutely because of like it's because of blood flow and like the like the redness of lips and cheeks and shit like that Yep, all of those things are true, but my point is When you asked about you change your profile pic doesn't matter and and my instant answer was Yeah, you got to pick one and kind of stick to it for a while very right
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm so sleek.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like I like Lisa car.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just like I keep changing shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like to be the same I I get that and that's fine If you do that, though, you'll just have to you'll just have to deal with Kind of the idea of re-engagement each time No That's okay That's fair Red conversation right a very hot red conversation
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so hold on a second.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's let's I'll come to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll ask you a question.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll bring you up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's be respectful of people speaking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go to Kevin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, good morning or good afternoon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kevin, what's going on?
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, good evening.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's almost three.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's actually past three o'clock now at this point.
[SPEAKER_06]: Back from vacation mode.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I haven't really been around spaces too often.
[SPEAKER_06]: But finally back.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had it every day, hopefully.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I like this topic.
[SPEAKER_06]: Your target audience like the whole color scheme that's going on as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's very psychological as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't really know about the red, but the reason why a lot of companies actually go for blue is because blue actually psychologically represents things like trust.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why a lot of social medias tend to really stem that way.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got things like Facebook, uh, Twitter back in the day, it's all about building trust within the community.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that all really, you know, plays into a part of, you know, the whole branding scheme of everything that goes on to it as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm doing great though.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, probably just gonna be listening and go to some work to do in the background.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I said.
[SPEAKER_06]: But always happy to be here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I appreciate you coming and joining and joining up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Kevin is the founder of the startup circle.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we have 6500 members now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And really started what a year, year ago, year just over a year ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, wow, you know, 11 and 13 months ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kevin doesn't know me.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, he's got 40,000 followers or something, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Kevin's in every space I'm in.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's been literally following me for years.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yup, bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: I literally just followed you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, you've been in every space I've been in.
[SPEAKER_07]: Go look at our history of messages.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's probably fucking years long.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't recall DMing you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I did DM you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, wait, now I'm confused.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, well, let's just let yeah, let's hit whoa.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was gonna go to Netta.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello Netta.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good afternoon.
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_03]: Good, thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi Kevin, it's been a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope you're well.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just have a really good question.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a topic that I absolutely love and I think it's kind of intersects with product management and a framework that I love.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is something I'm obsessed about, especially on my entrepreneurship journey that's begun much sooner than I thought.
[SPEAKER_03]: How?
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a framework and product management called.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's at the top of my head just when I need to know the job to be done.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's for a product, it's for a product.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whenever you have a product, what is the problem you really want to solve?
[SPEAKER_03]: Not the problem, it's the problem that your customers, that you need to read between the lines and requires research and data, but I think it also requires someone to have a knack.
[SPEAKER_03]: for recognizing what the actual, what is the actual problem they're solving?
[SPEAKER_03]: What is the problem they're solving with their service or product?
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, that's the better way to put it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I absolutely love this topic and I think that it could actually go beyond one space, but yeah, I'm looking forward to this and I'll stay for as long as I can.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So do you have a, so yes, I agree with you 100% that
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're doing product management, the product is solving a problem for the client.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what is the problem that the product solves?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, 100% agree with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have a specific question that I can get to quicker than other things?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be listening in.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm here more to learn right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have a question.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just trying to say that this
[SPEAKER_03]: The job to be done also addresses the target audience because it's a part of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just a statement.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, it does.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if, um, so you have to think that there are two circles we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first circle of audience is who you as a personal brand want to talk to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who do you want to interact with?
[SPEAKER_02]: And how do you want to be heard?
[SPEAKER_02]: And what do you want them to hear when they listen to you?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the first step.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll get to you, Dr. Q, in just a sec.
[SPEAKER_02]: The second circle is, if you're providing a service or a product, what problem is that solving for your audience?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm assuming your is the same as the product audience and your personal brand audience are overlapping.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to assume they're both the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the problem that you solve,
[SPEAKER_02]: is the reason why you have a product or service.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll give you an example.
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason we do what, the reason I talk about personal branding is because people feel invisible or they are invisible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when they reach out to someone, if they're known, if they have some point of reference, the barrier between trust and who the hell are you weirdo stranger
[SPEAKER_02]: gets shorter and shorter.
[SPEAKER_02]: So everybody starts with the idea that, who are you weirdo stranger?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we've been taught that way and we're just naturally that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then sometimes it takes seconds or hours or days or weeks or months or years to go from, oh, maybe it's a real nice person, we'll talk to him.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you're doing marketing and sales, when you're presenting yourself or presenting your offer,
[SPEAKER_02]: What you're attempting to do is make people from strangers to interested strangers to then becoming acquaintances and when they buy your product becoming friends in kind of a relationship kind of perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the problem is always what does your friend need that I can help with?
[SPEAKER_02]: What does your friend need that I can either provide a service or a product for to fix that?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then everyone else in the world
[SPEAKER_02]: is strangers until they become interested.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's called marketing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the sales process is turning them in from an interested bystander or an interested person to becoming, to having some kind of relationship.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want it to be a friendship.
[SPEAKER_02]: It might just be cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll take your stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't need you anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted your stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's good enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that, does that help your, the frame the question Netta?
[SPEAKER_03]: It does.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: The next step of that is to take, you know, your perspective glasses, put them on from the customer perspective and say, if I was the customer and I had that problem with the product I'm buying or service I'm buying, would it solve that?
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's that?
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like you're being a little too broad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, let's do a specific example.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're in a career executive and you're trying to get a job, and you've worked at one company for 10, 15 years, inside that company, you have a reputation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good, bad, indifferent, whatever, you have a reputation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people will say nice things about you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other people will be indifferent.
[SPEAKER_02]: The people who say nice things about you are who you put on your reference list when you go try to get a different job.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you try to get a job, you know, you're in company A and you go to company B and say, I'd like to be, I'm a director here and I wanna be a vice president there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they go, cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk and let's get some references.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, this is, you're the product.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're selling a product to the new company.
[SPEAKER_02]: The company has to figure out if they trust and believe what you said.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we typically do that through references, testimonials and other people.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they'll call up your references, and your references will say, yeah, Andy's a great guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: He does this, and he worked this project, and he ran this budget, and the guy's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd work for him.
[SPEAKER_02]: If he leaves, I'm going to go try to get a job wherever he goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, that means company B goes, cool, that's a great idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the flip side,
[SPEAKER_02]: Company B is also going to go check the internet for Andy.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because he just had his buddies talk to us, so cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll give him three points out of 10.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go see if we can prove that he is who he says he is without getting his hand picked people who he might have coached.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they find nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get no more points.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you try to get a job and you have a good interview,
[SPEAKER_02]: And they check your references and you get good references.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, but you only get half the points for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they go check the internet, in whatever way they do it, and they find I'm doing the same thing, I'm saying the same thing, my voice is the same when they read it, it sounds like I'm talking, I'm reading, I'm writing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They see mountains of evidence, thousands and thousands of posts.
[SPEAKER_02]: they can get a really comfortable, confident idea that I am who I say I am, and when I say I'm gonna do something, I can follow through, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Following through used to be proof because you had a degree.
[SPEAKER_02]: You start a program, you finish the program, they give you a certification or a degree, that certification was proof that you could follow through on instructions, and you could follow through on difficult things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have a higher likelihood of success at the new company.
[SPEAKER_02]: Specifically, college degrees, advanced college degrees, even advanced advanced, like master's and doctorate degrees, give you more and more and more credibility.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why if you have a doctorate degree, you can ask for a higher salary than you can if you have an associate's degree.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just the way it is because there are levels of trust that are implied with you completing those higher levels of degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the target audience,
[SPEAKER_02]: For Andy, if I'm a director and I'm trying to get a job as a vice president, my target audience is those companies that have a vice president opening.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my target audience.
[SPEAKER_02]: There might be three, four, five, 10 of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so that's a practical example.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's bring it down to where we typically are as humans here on this space.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are selling a product or a service.
[SPEAKER_02]: to other individuals or to other businesses.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in order to sell that product or service to other businesses, whether that's consulting by the hour, buying a course, buying a book, buying a program, buying a subscription, whatever it is, you need to target a group of people who have a high likelihood of success in needing your product.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I say who's your target audience, it should be around 10,000 people who have the characteristics of your current customers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Certain age, certain demographic, certain amount of income, certain amount of culture, probably a certain language, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It would do me no good for me to sell to executives in Japan if I don't speak Japanese.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't understand the Japanese language.
[SPEAKER_02]: And frankly, you must understand some portion of the language in order to understand the culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Having lived in multiple cultures and multiple languages, if you're in France, you speak zero French, you got no idea how French people think.
[SPEAKER_02]: Zero.
[SPEAKER_02]: Zero you can observe it you can make your own interpretation But you don't know how they think unless you can figure out what how they say things and how they?
[SPEAKER_02]: Imply importance with their language same thing when you live in Egypt.
[SPEAKER_02]: I lived in Egypt.
[SPEAKER_02]: I lived in France I lived in Romania.
[SPEAKER_02]: I lived in Turkey I lived there for extended periods of time in sometimes years okay, and
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're in Egypt, you cannot understand how Egyptians think unless you understand some portion of the language.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the same thing applies when you pick your target audience.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to be in the language that you typically speak, in the culture that you typically work and live and exist, navigate through,
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's going to be people who most likely are similar to you or similar to the problems that you're facing so that you can solve the problems because you have some kind of proof.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I say who's your target audience, I'm not talking about everyone in the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm talking about like between 1,000 and 10,000 people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if you're selling a 500, let's just be practical, you're selling a $500 product, $500 a month, or even $500 product, you only need 20 people to buy it every month to make $120,000 a year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Five, 500 times 20 is $10,000.
[SPEAKER_07]: Andy, you're always talking about big products and shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Break down like a $6 product.
[SPEAKER_02]: Five?
[SPEAKER_02]: Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on, hold on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, we'll get there in a second.
[SPEAKER_02]: A $6 product is like buying a hamburger.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, before I go too deep into that, let's go to Dr. Q. Hi, hello, I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, Andy.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure if we've talked before, but hello.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just want to appreciate you guys and everything like that, given the full color of this conversation, whether it's blue and red or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when you look at this, when we recursively look back at like this cognition that we're having, where it's like, so I'm a, my brand I do is like, I'm a memory architect with AI engineering.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do a lot of commentary stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I interact with humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you so much for having my people come into the conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: How you interact with people and everything like that is what is going to cover the conversation, right, Andy?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just want to say, like, you have been teaching me a lot about, like, hey, looking at your different social networks and how you interact with them, like, and what you were talking about, Andy, when you were talking about, like, different, like, circles of networks, like, for example, like
[SPEAKER_00]: here we are with a bunch of strangers and everything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know too many of you besides Kevin and Andy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, now that I did follow you though, by the way, and interact on those, it's like, that's how you like, it's not just customer support because it's like, how do you look at the client and like, what is, how's the client thinking?
[SPEAKER_00]: And those, there's a different colors of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to think of myself as green on like the heart tracker and everything like that because it's like, how do you feel?
[SPEAKER_00]: about this project that I'm trying to give out, or what am I trying to say about this sort of stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: And Andy, thank you so much for hosting this space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully I haven't, like, hopefully I've been able to give out what I had to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you're good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone has a different audience.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's eight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I read a thing that says there were not really eight billion people in the world because some countries are over counting, but okay, whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of people in the world, lots, like way more than five or 10,000 people.
[SPEAKER_02]: My point about the 10,000 number is just practical.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you talk to 100 people a day,
[SPEAKER_02]: Or if you reach out to 100 people a day, or you have 100 people read your stuff every day, 2 to 3% of them are going to be interested in what you say that day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that means of the 100, two, one or two people are going to go, Oh, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, Kev.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you do that for 100 days, you'll end up with 200 to 300 people on whatever interested in the thing you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you have 200 to 300 people interested in that, and you only sell, you convert the interest to sales of 10 people, and you're selling a $500 product, which by the way, a $500 product is not that much.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a car payment.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's even half of a car payment today.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not even your rent.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's some people's electric bill.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's some people's food bill for the month.
[SPEAKER_02]: $500 is not a big number.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a different number to each person.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you sell a $500 a month product, you only need 20 buyers to make $100,000 if you sell 20 every month.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And $500 is usually within the realm of possibility for everyone on the space.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether it's they have to put it on a credit card and they pay for it over a year, that's their choice on how to pay for it because of their economic condition.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people make more than $500 a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just go, yeah, okay, sure, here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just different.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if you sell a $500 product, and to get to $100,000, you only need to sell actually 18 1⁄2 of them, but we'll just say 20 because it's easier because there's churn.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you talk to 100 people a day, two of them are interested.
[SPEAKER_02]: You talk to 100 people the next day, you do that for 100 days, you have two to 300 people in your warm pipeline.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of those, you convert 10% of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So 2% engagement of the 100 a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And only 10% engagement of the two that engage left, you end up with 20 customers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty sure everyone here would take 20 customers paying $500 a month.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm trying to tell you, you can do that in three months if you simply talk to 100 people a day and offer them something for $500.
[SPEAKER_02]: 2% of them are going to buy it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Andy, I have a question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a new business idea, Andy.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to see what you think about it real quick.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like basically when people ever hit, whenever they hit the heavy bag, they never know if they're doing a good job and they film it a lot of times and they'll upload it on the internet for people to review it and judge it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was thinking about making a Fiverr account where I just be like, Hey, submit your like bag footage to me and I'll review it and then like give you a score and then like tips on how to get better.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you think that's a good idea or a shitty idea?
[SPEAKER_02]: I know of a guy who does that for people learning how to shoot basketballs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they film themselves on their iPhone shooting basketballs, and then they send it to him, and they pay him for him to give them shooting advice.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yes, it works.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's exactly what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: But here's the way he did it.
[SPEAKER_02]: He went to every, he found every single person who had a, was shooting baskets and then said, hey, and then he just went into their DMs, hit them up and said, here's, I do this and let me do this for you for free.
[SPEAKER_02]: Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Work on this and this and this and this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Upload a video and I'll check next time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the third or fourth time he said, hey, you know what, it's like five or ten bucks a month, and every time you send me a video every week, I'll critique you and give you coaching tips.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're saying it's not a bad idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: But remember, I look at is it a good idea if there's three things involved, okay?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I got this, not me, I got this from Alex Ramosi.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alex Ramosi says a good audience is number one, easy to find, number two, has sufficient numbers, has urgency and need, and third, they have enough money to pay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I built, I'll tell you, this is the Andy's stupid part.
[SPEAKER_02]: I built a program and a course to teach people how to get jobs in technology.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I got a bunch of people on a webinar, so I did all the marketing, got people on a webinar, and 20% of them bought it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And none of them actually used it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when I followed up, they said, yeah, I really like this thing, and I wanted to support you, and I wanted to buy your stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, do you need this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, no, not really.
[SPEAKER_02]: I already have a job and it dawned on me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm stupid because that audience has two of the three things.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're urgently, they have big hurt.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're easy to find.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have no money.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you help them solve their problem, they don't want to spend more money to continue to have.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like I'm selling hot dogs to a starving crowd.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as soon as the crowd is not starving anymore, they don't buy any more hot dogs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you can find the thousands of people who are hitting a heavy bag and want to do it better and are willing to pay you the five bucks a month or whatever you want to charge, go for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think the problem's going to be, how are you going to find 10 or 20,000 people who are interested in hitting a heavy bag and filming it and sending it to you?
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's up to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if you can find the audience, go for it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm posted online.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a very popular thing, and they're always like,
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if they're bragging or asking for critique, but probably both like I Mean, it's always both, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I guess I mean I just I don't know if there was a market for it or people would just be like Why would I do that when I can get it free online?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well some random dude would just comment like shit, but I guess I could set up a you know, a programmer So lessons to get better.
[SPEAKER_02]: I find it to your subscription list.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah find the market first.
I
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, before we go back to Dr. Q, hey, what's going on, Mullet?
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for taking the co-host spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, Mullet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, yeah, thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't really chimed in much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just got out of the gym.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just hanging out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Real quick, though, I did have a question.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was someone else that was trying to come up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want me to let anyone up, or how do you want me to do that?
[SPEAKER_02]: If they're following me or you, cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't know, just send me a DM.
[SPEAKER_02]: But here's the thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now, just let anybody up.
[SPEAKER_02]: If anybody wants to speak, fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they're a troll, trust me, I'll shut them down and send them away.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not worried about trolls, please.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're not polite, if you're disrespectful, or you're inappropriate, you're gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: And other than that,
[SPEAKER_02]: Come up, ask your questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, not a big deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Q, what's up now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I, so I'm not going to be the guy who usually I'm going to try and like elaborate on the question, but I do like looking methodically what you guys are talking about when it, like you look at your audience and it's like, so I love what you were giving with like the metaphor about like a starving hot dog, like Stan it's like, and hey, how do we keep retention on
[SPEAKER_00]: like our clients and everything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we like see the value about this stuff and keep retention on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why like sometimes when I kind of do my thing, I kind of like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm, I believe it deserves to be done for free.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need the money just yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like savings accounts, for example, always having like that, um, collateral on the back end, just to know that it's like, you know what, I want to pursue this like red hot topic, this red heart, like part of the market that I think is going to be important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm wondering actually, so for somebody who like myself, um, how would,
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, so calm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I love what Mel, Mel, um, Melrose was talking about, like commenting on people who might be haters and everything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: How would you approach somebody who is like on the network that is like a guest and everything like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody you may not know, but it's coming in saying some hot topic, red, hot, like information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you approach that signal.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you approach that signal?
[SPEAKER_02]: I listened to him and give him my honest opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But and I and you have been super I love the way that you like give out that information.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like you like don't gatekeep anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you want to you want to know that you want to know the way to succeed?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't gatekeep anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell everyone what you really think all the time, including the stuff that may cause other people to go Oh, you're a weirdo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I probably am.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know, if you like it or if you're okay with it, okay, fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're not, guess what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, I'm not looking for, so me personally, I am not looking for a million followers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am not looking for to become viral and an influencer of everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm only doing this because it's a grand experiment on my end because you guys are proving whether the stuff I'm saying has value or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you keep coming back, it does if all of a sudden I pull up a space and nobody joins and nobody asks and nobody Shows up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll realize what I'm saying is a bunch of crap and it's not worth anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not worth your time So it's a great evaluation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry Andy That's a great evaluation of your own metric right and like looking at like and you give so much value, dude I just wanted to shout that out to you are doing so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, thank you
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I'm not fishing for compliments, but I know, I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Listen, it's okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, the, the interesting thing is that in order to have a target audience, you have to have, so I'm assuming a number of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm assuming you were interested in creating a business and making money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm assuming that because you came to a startup circle space.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a startup circle space that is talking about your target audience assumes you know a few things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Branding, audience, that I'm trying to create an offer, I'm trying to sell something to somebody, awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't know and you're just listening, cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's for you, come back.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's not, okay, no problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: challenge is going to be, does this consistently have value?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it will to some people.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will not to others.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't gatekeep anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you ask, I will tell you my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: I might be wrong, but I am not in doubt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gay marriage?
[SPEAKER_02]: Currently it's legal in lots of places.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's legal in the entire United States.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you realize there are four continents of people?
[SPEAKER_02]: There are people on this space from four different continents.
[SPEAKER_02]: North America, South America, Europe, New Zealand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just saying, there are people on this space that are not Americans at all, that are not even close.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not even on the right.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not even on the right, the current, the same continent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jeez, the right continent.
[SPEAKER_02]: How terrible of that.
[SPEAKER_07]: The truth comes out.
[SPEAKER_02]: The right continent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I live on the left coast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, we were talking about time zones earlier with Fabio.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if he's still here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Time zones, you realize that the west coast of North America, if you're in the way that that Pacific time zone, just
[SPEAKER_02]: Canada the United States of Mexico just those little that little sliver of humanity is the only people in the world in that time zone Everything about how Jesus only had 12 followers, but made more of an impact than all of us Yes, it's a fascinating thing how about this I
[SPEAKER_02]: Of the twelve, he had three different groups inside that twelve.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was the four that he was closest to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then there was another four that were semi-close.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there was like an inner circle, a bigger circle, and then the others.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the rest.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just saying, like, he probably could have used one of these seminars.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would have been listening to him the entire time.
[SPEAKER_07]: So he only had twelve disciples.
[SPEAKER_07]: You have, like, how many?
[SPEAKER_07]: How many followers do you have?
[SPEAKER_02]: More than twelve.
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he had more he had more followers to explain that to him.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if I have 12 disciples at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway, well, let's let's go back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so your target audience, here's here's my main point in the target audience discussion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Choose a smaller audience, pick a more narrow niche, squeeze it even more than you think.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're going to start talking about products,
[SPEAKER_02]: and you're gonna solve it, don't look at products as a product offering, look at it as a solution offering, okay?
[SPEAKER_02]: So in other words, if you're gonna teach people how to get a job, you're gonna teach them all the steps necessary to get the next job, and when they get the job, expect them to leave and never come back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, when I was working in restaurants, I never expected people to go, show up, eat, and then immediately order more food and eat again.
[SPEAKER_02]: I expected them to eat, get done, finish, pay their bill, leave, and I would get more people that would show up, and I would help them, feed them, take care of them, make sure they did that, take their money, do the thing, and then they leave.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then more people would come.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, your target audience is based on your business model,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's also based on what your overall solution is.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is the problem you're solving?
[SPEAKER_02]: When I solve problems about personal branding, my goal is to help that company make money by helping their executives have a better personal brand because there's lots and lots and lots and lots and lots mountains of evidence
[SPEAKER_02]: that companies with visible leaders that have credible personal brands are worth more money in every possible dimension than companies that don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if you're a company that doesn't have visible, credible leadership, you are leaving money on the table.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so my target audience is those 10,000 business leaders, whether they run a company, whether they're an executive of a company, or they're a solo entrepreneur company that wants to make more money, that is my audience.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is my target audience that I sell things to, okay?
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody else is validating whether I'm saying it good, bad, indifferent, whether it's making an impact, whether it's not making an impact.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is basically, this is the proving ground, the laboratory of ideas.
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, is it- What does Peel have to say?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it Peel or Pele?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm curious now.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's got his hand up for quite a while.
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is, I'm sorry, can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you're loud.
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is, my name is Pella.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm here from Europe, from the Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm currently 17 years old.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I recently, six months ago, I decided to start a business.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm now, first, I want to do social media marketing.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I actually became to notice that I like branding more.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I saw you talking about branding.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was interested in what you had to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome, welcome from the Netherlands, Nita Landers, love that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you a skater?
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you a soccer player or a skater?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a hockey player.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, a hockey player.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you talked about audience and I think for everybody that's listening here, I think having your audience straight is one of the most important things.
[SPEAKER_05]: You also mentioned that narrowing down is one of the most important things and I can fully agree with that because
[SPEAKER_05]: When you have a business and a personal brand, you want to attract the right people to you.
[SPEAKER_05]: The reason they come to you is because they feel like you noticed their problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the bigger you go, the more vague and more...
[SPEAKER_05]: people, they can't really feel the connection to you, that you are really the person that can help their problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because let's say, okay, I do branding and I say, I help people to have like, to have a personal brand.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is, that audience, there's very, very, very, a lot of people want to have a personal brand.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm not really narrowing down there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the more I
[SPEAKER_05]: knees down with saying like, okay, I want to have people that are already have a following on Instagram and they currently struggling, they have a big audience but their engagement rate drops and they want to rebuild again their brand.
[SPEAKER_05]: If I post content and make an offer around that specific audience then people will resonate with that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So for everybody here,
[SPEAKER_05]: We are all business owners and we have a product or service that we sell.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you want to position the offer great, we need to...
[SPEAKER_05]: The more niche you go, the more people that are going to fall off, but the stronger connections are made.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how I'm thinking about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Pelé, that's the right way to think of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's audience first.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me give you an example.
[SPEAKER_02]: My brother-in-law has a martial arts school, successful school.
[SPEAKER_02]: And his first school was in a part of town that had average salaries and average income for the area.
[SPEAKER_02]: And let's say that whatever he made was 100% of his revenue.
[SPEAKER_02]: He started a new school in a much wealthier part of town.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bigger houses, a lot higher income, more revenue, nicer cars, etc.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of those things.
[SPEAKER_02]: With the same number of students, with the same amount of hours spent, the same amount of staff, he made 300% the same of his income that he had.
[SPEAKER_02]: With the exact same school, doing the exact same class schedule, with the exact same number of students, he was able to charge three times as much in a wealthier part of town.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was no difference in the quality of instruction that he gave or the quality of instruction that the students received.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was simply just pure economics.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had more money to spend and he raised his prices and made 300% doing the exact same thing just because he had a different audience.
[SPEAKER_07]: Andy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: My phone's on mute.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you bouncing or am I bouncing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you guys hear me?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I can hear you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to move Melrose.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to move you down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And come just invite.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just click the invite again.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll bring you back up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Pelle, yeah, I, yes, I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree the audience is the most important part.
[SPEAKER_02]: identifying your starving audience, and then giving them what they're what they're starving for is the way to make more money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think what you mentioned is great because what your brother actually did is just he positioned himself different.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yes, everything is the same, all business is the same, but he just moved to a better place and then
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, he made more money, but I think there are a lot of people that are in a position, but it's really hard to just say, okay, I'm going to serve richer people.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not harder.
[SPEAKER_02]: What it is, is just different than your expectation.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you grew up in a wealthy neighborhood and you went to country clubs every weekend, and you went to a private school where you wore a uniform and everybody drove around in Mercedes and BMWs, talking to other people who are quote-unquote rich people is just your friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's no different.
[SPEAKER_02]: But most people didn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't grow up in a neighborhood where
[SPEAKER_02]: They're dropped out where their parents, you know, take them in their Mercedes and drop them off at the private school.
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't grow up that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they believe in their mind somehow there's a difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no difference between them and you, especially if you solve their problems, they could care less where you come from.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't care.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody cares that Russell Brunson
[SPEAKER_02]: Who, you know, ClickFunnels, you guys know ClickFunnels, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Give me thumbs up if you know ClickFunnels, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody cares where Russell Brunson went to high school.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody cares if he had a Mercedes or a piece of crap car.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody cares.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody cares that when he went, by the way, the whole thing of ClickFunnels came because he was selling potato guns.
[SPEAKER_02]: piece of PVC, you stick a potato in one side, you put some lighter fluid in the other one, you seal it up, light it, and it goes boom, and shoots a potato.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said, yeah, okay, well, here's how you do the potato gun, and then, oh, here's how you add this next thing to it, and he realized that adding the next thing, and adding the next thing, and adding the next thing, that was the secret, not the potato gun.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so he sold potato guns and all this stuff in college or high school.
[SPEAKER_02]: I forget where it was, but he sold it all.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he realized that once they bought the first thing, they want to buy the next thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, well then you offer the next thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then they want to buy the third thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he realized that it was the sell the thing plus the next thing and the next thing and the next thing and the next thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they'll just keep buying from you because they want the thing, whatever you're, you're, you're selling.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was his epiphany.
[SPEAKER_02]: So go find him, Russell Brunson.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody cares where he came from.
[SPEAKER_02]: He talks about, recently he was on a podcast talking about, I joined a $18,000 mastermind for a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sat in the thing at the day, and he goes, there were like 18 people in the room, and the guy who was running the mastermind said, okay look, if you want to be on my podcast, it's $30,000.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said nine of the people who paid $18,000 each to be in the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: So 18 times 18 for just for that room for that day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then in the room he offered and made nine times 30,000 each.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he made almost $300,000 more by saying, you guys can be on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's $30,000 and we'll do this cool thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll interview you and then we'll promote it and blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said nine of the people joined it right then.
[SPEAKER_02]: and they had already paid $18,000 to be in the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: The amount of money that's available is staggering.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there is no shortage of money.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have a good deal, where I said something like, if you buy this thing from me for $10 and use it, you'll make $100.
[SPEAKER_02]: You wanna know how many people will sign up for that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, all the people, all of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's true, if it works, then they'll sign up for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no shortage of money.
[SPEAKER_02]: And more importantly, if you said, I've got this thing, it's 10 bucks, and if you do it, you'll make 100 bucks, and they show that it works, okay?
[SPEAKER_02]: All of a sudden, you now can leverage that idea and the proof that it works three or four or five or 10 times into literally millions of dollars of funding almost instantaneously.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because everybody's looking for a 10 to 1 return.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put in $1, get $10 back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put in $10, get $100 back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put in $100, get $1,000 back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then it's just a matter of how much money do you put in?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, all the money.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are, there literally are businesses like that in the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are.
[SPEAKER_05]: Andy, I have one question for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: For me, my services, I offer a whole branding service and I have different, I have the one-time branding.
[SPEAKER_05]: First, I need to dial down what the intention of the whole motive of the founder was and why they even started the company.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because if you want to express your brand, I think it needs to come down from their own values because otherwise, if you just
[SPEAKER_05]: write, think about something and say, okay, wait, that's my brand.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't really think that it's going to be a strong brand.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the first thing I do is the branding part.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then after we decided that we're going to do the distribution, but of course I can help people with to find their brand.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the next step is next question for them is that, okay, how do I now distribute this to my content?
[SPEAKER_05]: And then number, uh,
[SPEAKER_05]: 3 is actually the distribution, so first branding, then the marketing strategy and then distribution.
[SPEAKER_05]: How much do you think I can sell that offer for?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so first of all, you're doing great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your English is wonderful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead and slow down.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're nervous, it's okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just slow down.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't matter how long it takes you to say it, okay?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're good on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, my first question is, who is your audience?
[SPEAKER_02]: Who are you actually targeting?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you give me a kind of a definition of who they are?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, there are...
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry for the fast speaking.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're totally fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just trying to give you confidence.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Slow down.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take your time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, their founders, they're currently posting themselves or they have built an audience, they have built an audience on Instagram or on other social platform and they currently struggle with expression of
[SPEAKER_05]: really get people to really like their brand or really feel something about your brand and then that they not just copy other businesses that are doing the same type of content.
[SPEAKER_05]: So founders that are already posting have a decent amount of money made and currently having a problem with the branding distribution.
[SPEAKER_02]: How, how can you tell if they have a
[SPEAKER_02]: How can you tell that they have these characteristics that you just mentioned?
[SPEAKER_05]: Now it comes down, first I obviously observe their accounts and look what they're currently, how big of a company they are because that's something most of the times I can search or research and then how is their current
[SPEAKER_05]: social media going if they if I see that they put a lot of effort in it but don't really get the results or get results that they I think they can have then there's a little bit of a gap there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So essentially you research their account you evaluate what they're doing and then you're seeing if they're getting the type of expected results or engagements that you think were or at least a standard should be.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if they're below that standard, you're targeting that person, that individual, that account.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: For me, also, I have done the research.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have searched a brand that do branding well.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I could say that I have a decent understanding of brands that are doing a great job at branding and really have a big cult or people that really share
[SPEAKER_05]: they have equalized the values of their brand aligned with the customers.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's the biggest part.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if the content doesn't really involve storytelling or showing the values from their own brand to the customers, then it feels not really like a brand and more copying viral trend strategies.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if I see that,
[SPEAKER_05]: that they, they try, but the founder, um, and of course I need to do that with outreach.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, the founder wants to express their, um, brand.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then I'm the one that's think that's going to help them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got, um, I understand.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're doing some evaluation on their account and then you're determining whether you should
[SPEAKER_02]: engage with them or not, and then how you would approach that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, that's fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a couple questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you tracking these individuals?
[SPEAKER_02]: And what type of, do you have a systematic way of approaching them?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, for me, um, first step is, uh, look at accounts or people, or I guess, uh, with my eggs, I want to build a brand around also branding.
[SPEAKER_05]: So then I'll get inbound leads.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, um, this first, I look at people accounts in my region around my, um, where I live in Rotterdam access to be specific.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, um, okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then I, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep going.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I, um, so I checked them and I want to, um, know if they're, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's their intention of even starting social media?
[SPEAKER_05]: What's their reason for doing it and how are they currently doing content?
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I going to ask them in, uh, in the DMs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, are you targeting, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're targeting local, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you only using Instagram and X or are you using LinkedIn as well?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm not on LinkedIn right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you should totally be on LinkedIn.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason is because founders will always put their name and they will put that they're a founder in LinkedIn.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can easily search.
[SPEAKER_02]: founders in Rotterdam or whatever the right word is, you can look for those founders in and around your area so that you can have an even more personalized engagement.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, as you increase in
[SPEAKER_02]: let's say economic capabilities.
[SPEAKER_02]: In other words, when they have more money and they have more visibility, more personalization matters.
[SPEAKER_02]: In other words, the president of the new whatever company, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: The founder of this new SaaS company, Software as a Service, this founder has some funding and wants to make a splash, wants to be known, wants to have some kind of impact.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have way more money than somebody who's just trying to sell a book.
[SPEAKER_02]: So point, find them,
[SPEAKER_02]: point to them and say, this is the things that we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: We customize it specifically for people just like you.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is how we do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what we do, and this is what you can expect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that will help you massively.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's what I do, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm not targeting people in and around Rotterdam.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm targeting people in Northern California, near San Francisco, in the Bay Area, because that's where I live.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think, of course, I came here on X because I knew there were more founders here on X than actually on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_05]: But LinkedIn is also a great platform for me to look at.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm definitely going to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other thing to look up, specifically since we're doing the same kind of things in different areas, research
[SPEAKER_02]: on your favorite LLM or whatever research you want on the best times, the best frequency, the best type of content.
[SPEAKER_02]: The way that I teach it is that you need three things to have a personal brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need your voice or the client needs to have the client's voice identified.
[SPEAKER_02]: The client's audience and the client's superpower, the thing that they do well, that they've done over and over again that they can reproduce and help people with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those three things are what each individual brand requires.
[SPEAKER_02]: How we deliver it, whether it's by stories or by pictures or by video, face, if it's on this platform or that platform, all those things are variables.
[SPEAKER_02]: but they must have a defined voice.
[SPEAKER_02]: How they talk, how they speak, how they present themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Number two, they need to choose who their audience is so that their message comes across.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they need to have the superpowers or their zone of genius, their core competent, their content pillars, the things they talk about.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here's how you figure out what your audience really needs.
[SPEAKER_02]: You take your audience's top 10 problems and overlap them with your superpowers or the brand's audience and the brand's superpower, whatever the brand's audience problems are and the brand's superpower, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I help people clearly create branding.
[SPEAKER_02]: I help them by establishing their own voice, their own audience, and their own superpowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then using their audience, their target audience, plus their superpowers, the overlap of that is what they should be selling.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that's the thing that they can do well without effort that your audience needs.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the way that I build these brands.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the way that I produce the results that I'm producing because it's an overlap of those two things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's personal.
[SPEAKER_05]: The superpower was actually not the thing I was thinking about.
[SPEAKER_05]: The other two things, of course, they need to have their own voice and their story need to align and their audience need to be picked right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think what you're essentially doing is making it easier for the founder to really feel comfortable having his own personal brand and to really push on his, yeah, their superpower.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's a great one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, well, I didn't even come up with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody else pointed it out to me, and then I just adopted it.
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, none of this stuff I thought of on my own.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was all things that I just learned from other people and applied together, and now I'm just sharing it with everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Lazy Canadian Investor encouraged me a week ago or last week, whatever it was, and said, don't gatekeep anything, just tell everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is exactly how we do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is exactly how I do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can personalize your content, customize to your audience, overlapping with your superpower.
[SPEAKER_02]: So every single time you speak, it's authentically you in a way that solves problems that are obvious and clear that you can solve them, pointed directly at an audience that needs it solved.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is why my blog's got two million page views in 19 months because I use that exact same methodology to target their pain with the things that I can do so that every time I talk, they go, yeah, okay, that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you can help founders do the same thing where the founder can talk to their audience about the things the founder does super well,
[SPEAKER_02]: It is guaranteed authenticity.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's why it works.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, this one's great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you're doing well, Andy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the authenticity is the best one.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the things I see when I look at possible leads is that the authenticity isn't really there.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're just trying to put content out, trying to... Because I don't...
[SPEAKER_05]: I do both things.
[SPEAKER_05]: I do personal branding, but also e-commerce brands.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I focus on that and when the founders are also not only putting out offers, spamming everyone's mailboxes, but also sharing their stories, share their volumes, sharing the behind the scenes, how they put the product, why the reason they do so, because that is when you're really building an engaged audience and not just following trends.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, then there's and and a little bit we're going to talk about this a little more tomorrow Where you know what tomorrow is going to be like ask Andy anything so you can come up and ask me anything you want but
[SPEAKER_02]: Specifically, there are multiple phases of this type of modeling or branding engagement.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the initial push of getting people interested in whatever you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's the consistency and that sustained consistency over time that you can look back at my blog and see that I've literally posted something every single month in for about 17 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some months have been more, some months have been less.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty recently it's been five, six days a week.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's undeniable when you put something that's been around for a long, long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I started my own personal brand, my own personal blog in 2008.
[SPEAKER_02]: long-term.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah I think a personal brand is also not something you can decide in one go and just say okay now I'm going to serve that type of people or the next day okay I'm going to chase that because the consistency is what you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_05]: You need to have consistency other for people to pair you with
[SPEAKER_05]: Solving that you can solve the problem and that takes time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes So burning is pairing pairing with the audience and you needs to pair or associate you could say it in both ways but pair you with The thing that you want them to see you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, listen for a 17 year old you have a lot of Wonderful questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on back anytime.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're gonna go to Katie now we're just at the end of my time, but
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll go to Katie real quickly, and then we'll come back tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same time, noon Pacific, is when I start this space.
[SPEAKER_02]: It usually goes for one hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: But hello, Katie.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, lovely.
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_04]: good.
[SPEAKER_04]: I am fantastic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like a boss.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: There's often times I come into your space and I'm like, hmm, but today I feel like a boss.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, I, I don't know if you know this, but I'm actually part of this
[SPEAKER_04]: cohort in the UK, basically about, oh gosh, how do I best explain this?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, I don't know how to explain it, but whatever, I'm very honored to be part of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the point of me wanting to share something is that very few people were selected to join this cohort.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what we had been doing and have been doing
[SPEAKER_04]: is stripping everything back and taking a look at exactly, I guess, what your title says.
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's your target audience?
[SPEAKER_04]: What is innovation?
[SPEAKER_04]: Why do we do it?
[SPEAKER_04]: What's innovation in customer success definition and journey mapping and VPs and things like this?
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been using this Miro board, but also people can use Figma or anything else that they prefer.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been such an incredible experience to go through of journey mapping and client or customer personas to really figure out, you know, who your target audience actually really is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, in one hand, like my grandfather would say, you throw enough money against the wall, some's got to stick.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a problem, you're providing the solution.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to live happily ever after.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not the case.
[SPEAKER_04]: You literally have to step into the
[SPEAKER_04]: mind, body and soul of the user, or buyer, or what, you know, whether it's a product, service, or yourself, you know, about your, your own self brand, and be very self reflective.
[SPEAKER_04]: But looking at this from a different perspective, rather than, I just want to do everything to appease people, because I believe in what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually the other way around.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, here's a smashing idea or this is who I am as a person But it's really carving out how one wishes to be identified and working those steps back almost as if you are your mirrored reflection and You're looking at it from a different point of view.
[SPEAKER_04]: Does that make sense Andy?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, you you've tiptoed into the the the dark underbelly of branding.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what that is.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is that you want
[SPEAKER_02]: a brand to reflect who you imagine you are, but you have to grow into who you imagine you are in order for the brand to work.
[SPEAKER_04]: Amen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that is why oftentimes, even though I talk about branding, I often talk about
[SPEAKER_02]: mindset and growth and becoming a little more likable and a little better communicator.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not saying you should become the most likable person in the world, but there's no, there's zero downside to having a little charm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Zero.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's zero downside to having a little charm.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, let me, let me give you a really dumb example.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is such a dumb example, but it's, it works.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanos was charging, was,
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanos was charming, but he was also just incessantly evil and needed everyone in the world and everything in the entire Marvel Universe to destroy him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yet he was still charming.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because he was charming, it takes the edge off of the horribleness of Thanos, the character.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I, by the way, I use that so I don't have to point out a human being as being
[SPEAKER_02]: evil and charming because I truly have no idea if people are evil or just they do bad things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Simon Cowell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, people Yes, I you know, the thing is, like, evil Knievel, you do you know who evil Knievel is the guy that jumped over?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, evil Knievel was basically a just a rat bastard his whole entire life until the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then at the end, he gave his life to God.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then for the last literally few months and years of his life, he made a massively different impact than he had being a rat bastard his whole life.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so in that vein, I'm going to refrain from ever calling humans evil because I don't know, it's never over till it's over.
[SPEAKER_02]: The story is not complete and inked and the book finished until it's all over and done with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there have been many, many people in the world who lived a horrible life and at the end redeemed themselves in a magnificent way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though, I mean, it's a great story.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a magnificent thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, I don't ever recommend you live that life thinking at the end you're going to just, you know, switch over and be a saint at the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it does happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Please may I do a space with you on journey mapping and going into the dark underbelly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whenever you're ready, it doesn't have to be immediately, but I would love to go into a space with you about all that I have learned and pick your brain and share with everyone what I have learned.
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be such an honor.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd really appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well anytime katie, uh, you are a delightful person and I would love to speak with you anytime We know what we should do is we should do a podcast where we just get on and record the whole thing and then share it with everyone else Okay, we'll talk in the back channels that'll work I can do that Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, i'm a few minutes over mullet any last words
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's been great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Always always great to hear from you and the other people who come up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys definitely know a lot about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm I'm excited to sit back and learn from you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I appreciate you taking the co-host spaces, pushing some of the buttons and being in the background.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for helping that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a big help.
[SPEAKER_02]: It lets me think about the questions more so that I can give the best answer I can, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, take my answers with a grain of salt.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're probably true.
[SPEAKER_02]: They might even be in the right direction, but you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I could be totally wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I'm wrong tomorrow, I'll tell you, hey, you know what I said yesterday?
[SPEAKER_02]: I learned that I was a big idiot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And let me correct that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The point is, life is not a stair step like you were kind of implied and taught in school.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every school everywhere in the world teaches the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you follow this path, you will be successful and live a great life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, not true.
[SPEAKER_02]: Life doesn't care.
[SPEAKER_02]: The universe has zero.
[SPEAKER_02]: zero to do with what you think you're entitled to.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will only give you what you've done and what you're actually doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will only result in the behaviors that you have.
[SPEAKER_02]: They will give you the results of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything else is just human wisdom applied on top of basically dirty diapers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just don't, don't believe that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, I could be full of, you know, uh, manure one day, not
[SPEAKER_02]: not intentionally evil, just wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: I admit when I'm wrong and I want you guys to know that right up front.
[SPEAKER_02]: So feel free to come back and if I am wrong pointed out, I'll change.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that in mind, you guys have a wonderful, fantastic day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason that I do this is very simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason is because there are many, many people in the world who are on their hands and knees right now begging God for an answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they just don't know where to go to get the answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you have the answer to their problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: You here on this space or listening to the recording, you have the answer to their problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what you need to do is you need to tell the world that you can solve this one problem, whatever it is, and those people in their hands and knees will find you and work with you and get that problem solved and be eternally, ever forever grateful to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it only happens if you're willing to go out into the darkness with your torch.
[SPEAKER_02]: So grab your torch, light it, carry it out into the cold, dark world because there are people who need you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys have a great day.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see you tomorrow, bye.
