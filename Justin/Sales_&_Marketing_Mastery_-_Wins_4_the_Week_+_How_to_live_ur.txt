[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, great to have you guys aboard.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good to see you, Andy, Vivi, Christelle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Always a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Waves are pretty big today.
[SPEAKER_03]: The waves are pretty big.
[SPEAKER_03]: Looking at some nice barrels right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, I hope everyone's doing well.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're in the Startup Circle community.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Friday, so that's our community space in the Strong Circle.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll be talking about wins for the week and how to live your brand, why you live in your brand, and some pro tips around that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, welcome, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Please like and repost the space.
[SPEAKER_03]: We really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I hope you guys, this Friday is off to a good start so far.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, let's check in with Andy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Andy, good morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good morning, you know, I have a It's funny you said the like and repost the space.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so I was on an all-hands meeting with a big organization that I support yesterday and Thousands of people listening and ironically every single speaker every single comment was full of
[SPEAKER_02]: hearts claps thumbs up just a constant stream and I thought who are these people we're listening for two hours
[SPEAKER_02]: And someone's like spamming the emoji button the entire time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it was a flood.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't like every now and then, oh, here's a couple of thumbs up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like hearts, hearts, hearts, hearts, flowers, balloons, flowers, balloons, flowers, hearts, hearts, thumbs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_02]: At some point, I just thought.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had two thoughts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's my two crazy thoughts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Number one, are they really that excited?
[SPEAKER_02]: And number two, are they really just that eager to please that they just are like, yes, yes, yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, that's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, wait, because Meta, Google, Paramount,
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Amazon, just layoffs everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they just shilling to keep their job, or are they shilling because they do that, or is it a combination of all the above?
[SPEAKER_02]: But the bottom line is, you know what my win for the week is?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm here, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Woke up this morning, sucked air, that's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's my favorite day that ends in Y, and I'm here working, working for clients,
[SPEAKER_02]: and making some amount of money and building a plan.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's my win for the week is, you know, made it here on another day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And how do I live my brand?
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, I wear a black shirt and I show up every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: How about that?
[SPEAKER_03]: That works for me, Andy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the consistency is a big part of it and the discipline.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you definitely got that locked in.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, that's definitely your your black attire is your is your brand.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what you always wear.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that's your style.
[SPEAKER_03]: So following Steve Jobs's model, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, I didn't follow any model.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I I read a book about Einstein wore the same clothes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I saw a stupid movie that said Zuckerberg wore the same clothes.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was because they didn't have to think about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, oh, that's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the, so I, I picked like the same shirts, the same pants, the same shoes, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the same all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, uh, the reason black was because I, I lived and worked in Egypt for a couple of years and Egypt, the sand is like talcum powder.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll get your fingernails.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll get in your teeth.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll get in your clothes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll get in the seams of your clothes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the only thing that didn't show it as just like you walk home, like you're, you know, pig pen from the,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the Peanuts character, was wearing a black shirt, didn't show as much.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I thought, a black shirt doesn't show as much.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's hot, if I sweat, they can't see as much.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I spill, they can't see as much.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was truly a 100% practical solution to a problem I had.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I just stuck with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It had nothing to do with anything cool
[SPEAKER_02]: or awesome it was literally purely practical Andy so I didn't have to think about anything and I didn't show my sweat stains when I spill on my big fat stupid self.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the practicality angle yeah and and there's something to be said about there's a lot of geniuses that if you
[SPEAKER_03]: if you work with geniuses, you'll notice that some of the simplest things like attire, or I'm trying to think of another example, just they get into these success habits or routines that eliminate decision-making, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they want the shortest path to a decision where they don't have to think about it, and it just becomes so automatic that they can focus their brain power on other things, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, think of it this way.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you spend one whole entire day on what your wardrobe looks like, the whole day and you evaluate every single thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: What kind of socks do I wear?
[SPEAKER_02]: What kind of shoes are they?
[SPEAKER_02]: What is my casual, my beach, my casual, my semi-formal, my formal, my tuxedo?
[SPEAKER_02]: What does that all look like?
[SPEAKER_02]: And just literally go through everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then make that decision one time and then just live with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guess what?
[SPEAKER_03]: Never have to decide again Yeah, well said well, thanks andy for being here and uh, so good to have you on the panel here today as co-hosts and Really looking forward to this discussion And we got timo and christelle Uh and bb here on the panel.

[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, so good to see you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hope you're having a great morning so far.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, we got Alex and we got Tolu as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, so yeah, let's jump right over to Timo and Christo and BB, and then we'll, you know, get the conversation going here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So.
[SPEAKER_03]: And please be sure to check out our sponsor here, Play.
[SPEAKER_03]: Play is an AI ads-powered platform.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's never been easier to launch ads, guys, okay?
[SPEAKER_03]: I use this tool.
[SPEAKER_03]: My clients use this tool.
[SPEAKER_03]: My students use this tool.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, if you're not running your ads powered by AI, like, you know, you're leaving money on the table and you're wasting money.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I did a split test between
[SPEAKER_03]: here's the AI ads powered platform ads campaign for Facebook.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then here's the non AI ads power pump.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to do another test and I'm going to document it, uh, you know, probably in November.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the point is if you're not using AI to help run your ads, like you're, you're, you're wasting money, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You're wasting money.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, it's not as efficient.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not as affordable.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, with the auto optimize feature,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, you just click a toggle on button, it'll auto optimize all the tests.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like this is a cheat code, you know, so definitely check it out guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: I created a landing page for it specifically.
[SPEAKER_03]: So definitely check it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go over to Timo.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we'll go to Christel and Bibi.
[SPEAKER_03]: Timo, what's going on, man?
[SPEAKER_03]: Happy Friday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy Friday, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey,
[SPEAKER_00]: work week is done, the real hustle begins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see, busy day, had to go through some documentation, got some weird thingy coming down from the ministry, so kind of had to take a look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically Department of Finance and Department of Healthcare.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, then
[SPEAKER_00]: wins for the week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one of the wins obviously is that the ad campaign or the ad revenue stuff is starting to really kick in and now I just have to figure out how I can flame bait Andy to click those links and get six bucks more from email.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, the
[SPEAKER_00]: That is working well, I'm projected to make a bit over 200 bucks for this month, next month I'm aiming for 400 to 500.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just building that, scaling that up as we go and more people sign up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the biggest win I think was to get hoops
[SPEAKER_00]: make a video of me and Kristal about newsletters without us asking for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's living the brand when other people are kind of picking it up and without any requests, just spreading the love.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a great win.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do have to mention, I do have to do some stuff around the house at the moment, but I'll click the buttons if people want to request and whatnot, but I'll put my hand up back when I'm actually gonna be speaking or able to speak again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that was an awesome video that Hoops did and congrats on that good month here for the beehive.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and yeah, it's only going to get, it's only going to grow from here.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that's, that's the thing about sustainable growth.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my favorite type of growth is sustainable, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Sustainable growth, because, um, and working for startups in the past, like, you know, some of those startups aren't around anymore and.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's because we grew too quickly or, you know, didn't have the best product market fit or fill in the blank.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the best growth is always sustainable growth.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you can stay lean and mean and an AI powered machine and you can grow your list and can grow your revenue.
[SPEAKER_03]: at the same rate and correlation, you're going to be in a good position.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you just, you just don't want to stop.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, and I know Timo, you know, he will not take his foot off the gas, which is a trait that very few possess.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you can stick it out, you're, you know, I'm looking forward in like five years here, or sorry, in three more years, because we've already been on this journey for two years.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just think where we'll be when we're, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: Who do you think we should have a Who do we think is the person who's going to break out?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're all doing a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're all doing these things and then one person is going to like go boom and they're going to hit something and that virality is going to happen and then they're going to be making a
[SPEAKER_02]: 20 30 40 50k a month and they're gonna be telling us how they did it Somebody somebody on one of these shows somebody on one of these communities part of our community Somebody's gonna do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I I'm all for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just Know not sure who it's gonna be Yeah, I mean Hey, good to see you Antonio.
[SPEAKER_03]: I I'd say I
[SPEAKER_03]: In all likelihood, it's most likely going to come from somebody on this platform that does a video on TikTok that goes viral, okay?
[SPEAKER_03]: Just because of like the virality nature of TikTok, it's pretty big, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's literally people, and you guys know him.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, what's his name, Chris, or I got to find his, his handle here, but he was, uh, he's been on our spaces, a sales guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's been in sales for many years and he quit his job to create video content for companies on Tik TOK.
[SPEAKER_03]: He quit his job.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, you know what, I I'm, I'm going to do this and I'm going to do this full time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so he started filming landscaping companies doing the transformations and then boom, like one of his videos blew up, went viral.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now he's like on Tik TOK and, you know, sharing the journey of building a public.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's literally from X.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like he, he, he's been on our spaces.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's been in the rooms.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to find his name and I'm going to, you know, acknowledge him because he's doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's doing it, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: He literally quit his job, his sales job, and he went all in on creating viral video content for businesses on TikTok.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's exactly his business model.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's crushing it right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's crushing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think my prediction is that, yeah, you may get a viral post.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't really like to chase virality.
[SPEAKER_03]: And honestly, I like to chase sustainability and sustainable growth.
[SPEAKER_03]: But hey, if I create a TikTok video that gets a million views and blows up, all right, awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, that'd be great.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, I think we're all here for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think somebody will, will break out and have this like breakout post or, you know, viral moment on TikTok or whatever platform.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the other, you know, normal people, I mean, we're, well, you can't be normal and be an entrepreneur.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just let me put that out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, there's no normalcy about being an entrepreneur.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, the sacrifices, the heartache, the pain, the, you know, fill in the blank, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: The loneliness.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is why I show up to X every day.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is therapeutic for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, this is therapy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, you know how much money I save on therapy by going to spaces?
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, this is real talk right here, okay?
[SPEAKER_03]: This is how I keep my sanity, all right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, I really think someone will have a breakout, a viral video.
[SPEAKER_03]: Majority of us will just continue to get sustainable growth.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you can stick it out for five years, cause we're already two years in, Christelle's longer in the journey, but if you can stick it out for five years, you can have a sustainable business, a legacy business, and you can just stack those revenue streams.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, all right, let's go over to Christelle and then Bibi.
[SPEAKER_03]: And shout out to John Carlos, and Dan, and Antonio, and Tolu.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good to see you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Please like and repost.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'd really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, Christelle, happy Friday.
[SPEAKER_03]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_01]: I assume you can hear me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me know if you can't.
[SPEAKER_01]: But hi, happy Friday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Justin, Andy, Timo, VB, John Carlos, Dan, Ryan, Antonio, Tolu.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very happy it's Friday and Romeo is very happy because it's his favorite holiday even though I tried to hide the Halloween stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: He found it, put it back out, so I gave in and he's so cute.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's in his Spider-Man oversized pajamas today because that's the costume that I got.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, it's Patricia's birthday, so I believe she's hosting a space around now all day, so I'm gonna try to support her at some time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope she shares her story, because she has a really, really incredible, powerful story.
[SPEAKER_01]: We spent some time together on Zooms planning that workshop that we did, and I would say my wins this week are getting back to collaborating and connecting
[SPEAKER_01]: with people, even the group that we've been forming in here informally, but I think Ani is going to really start it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been calling it three click mafia because we're talking about all week, you know, clicking each other's newsletters and clicking on the ads and helping each other make money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fun to me now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a game.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like in the middle of sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not even all the way awake.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, oh, Megan newsletter, click, click.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Close the phone like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like, that's why I'm calling it three click mafia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just three clicks and your friends make money.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, that's a big win getting back on Beehive and like being monetized same day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I love Beehive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to stop making money with them ever again.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was I thinking?
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you Timo and everyone for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a big win.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so yeah, we're working on the next big project, which is the 30-day challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm excited about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm putting a group together.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to be inviting you guys as well, because I'm building a speaker expert panel for what I'm calling the ultimate brand trifecta.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the first time I've actually shared it publicly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a process of building three things, your branded landing page, right, that's with the affiliate links, all that, your monetized landing page, your newsletter, of course, and then now we're adding the book to it and using Daniel Priestley's model.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in 30 days, it's gonna be a challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Justin, remember the first 30-day challenge I did?
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the best challenge I ever did.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was 30 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: and I used Pedro Adeo's model.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you ever want to do a challenge, ask ChatGBT to design a challenge for you using Pedro Adeo's model, because he's the challenge guy, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the tricks with AI, like figure out who's doing it the best or really well and have AI do it like them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, of course, I also use Daniel Priestly and Alex Hermosi.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, one day I'm going to be like, build this like Andy, build my brand blueprint using Andy.
[SPEAKER_01]: brain, build my sales and marketing using Justin's brain, which now Justin has his revenue run in AI.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I believe that's where we're going very, very soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it's been a great week of connecting back with community and people here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, happy to see Dan Ryan here on a Friday, happy over the mastermind that we had just a really great, great week.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, much love everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you guys hear me?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we can.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a nice another little moment of silence, not as long as yesterday's.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, we had and I know Timo loved it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Timo was basking.
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of ads are those with Justin?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are those Facebook ads or Google ads?
