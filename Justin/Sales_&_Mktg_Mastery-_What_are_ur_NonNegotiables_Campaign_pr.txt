[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome, my friends, to another Startup Circle space.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yes, we're in the Startup Circle today.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Monday.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hope everyone had a great weekend.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, good to see you, Adam, the job father.
[SPEAKER_04]: Justin, good to see you, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Resilience.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that name.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's one of my favorite words.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, great to have you guys aboard here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for being here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Antonio is there also.
[SPEAKER_04]: Great to see you, Antonio.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's our newest Ronin member, so great to have you aboard, Antonio.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, while we're getting acquainted here, or getting the show kicked off, so we had a pop-up space on Saturday when Justin was there.
[SPEAKER_04]: the job father.
[SPEAKER_04]: And man, let me tell you, it got pretty spicy.
[SPEAKER_04]: It got pretty spicy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was in work mode on a Saturday because I was working all day.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, because sometimes we got to go extra, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: We got to do not just what's necessary.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got to do what's required.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what it takes sometimes when you're running your own business.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then some people
[SPEAKER_04]: They can't handle that, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So, but I'm one of those types of people, as you know, or hopefully, you know, by now, like I do whatever it takes, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: I do whatever it takes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, and yeah, I encourage others to go listen to that replay.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you, if you want some alpha, if you want like a really good mastermind,
[SPEAKER_04]: It was excellent.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was excellent.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm sure everyone that left there came away inspired and with a lot of value.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, but yeah, good to see you, Adam.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good to see you, Netta, Danielle, Antonio, the job father.
[SPEAKER_04]: Always great to see you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Familiar faces and some new faces.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Please like and repost the space.
[SPEAKER_04]: Would really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, we're going to get into our mastermind here in a second.
[SPEAKER_04]: Andy may or may not be here.
[SPEAKER_04]: He had some prior obligations, so he may or may not be here.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, you know, shout out to Netta.
[SPEAKER_04]: Netta was hosting a space on Saturday as well that I was able to pop in on.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, there's a lot of great people hosting great spaces and a lot of value out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And and this in particular in the startup circle, it's focused around, you know, building your startup.
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, building your business all around sales, marketing mastery, which are the two biggest business drivers of any company.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you're not mastering sales or marketing yourself, you know, you may have some challenges because it's, it's two skills that just everyone needs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone needs to master sales and marketing, um, and at least have that foundational knowledge so that you can either manage someone else or pay someone else to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But at least you have those foundations and those fundamentals down.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, but yeah, welcome, everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get some people up to the stage here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good to see you, Jason, Christelle.
[SPEAKER_04]: Man, Christelle, Saturday was spicy, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Saturday was spicy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I worked all day Saturday after that space.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I actually spent some fortunate time with one of my buddies who I grew up with in my 20s and 30s.
[SPEAKER_04]: He turned 50 he turned 50 so man it was Wow Reminiscing with him is you know gathering with and he's a grandpa now.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got like a two-year-old Grandson, so yeah, I mean it's crazy How time flies by so quickly?
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, I was able to work the whole day Saturday got some extra stuff done
[SPEAKER_04]: Celebrated with him.
[SPEAKER_04]: He turned 50 and then Sunday was pumpkin patch, you know, it was like pumpkin patch day.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Took the wife and my daughter to a local pumpkin here a really famous called Bates nuts farm and Really famous place in Valley Center.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was fun And yeah, you know ready to hit it hard again.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to my clients here in San Diego for
[SPEAKER_04]: You know my schedule is like Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday in office for this new clients for the first month in office and then after that it's going to be remote only like maybe one day a week in the office, but I really like in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, doing that FaceTime, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: You gotta do that FaceTime in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then once they know you, like you, trust you, see the results you deliver, then they're like, okay, yeah, Justin can work remotely.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, that's the style.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, that's how we set this relationship up.
[SPEAKER_04]: So today's gonna be a great topic.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, what are your non-negotiables?
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is a big one.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a big one.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't mean just personally, but also professionally.
[SPEAKER_04]: right so you know we all have our non-negotiables personally and then we have our non-negotiables professionally and i like to keep things separate to the point where i even had in the past like i have a personal facebook and i have a business facebook why why because you know i i don't want to mix like people i went to high school with on my personal facebook with like
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, professional stuff, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: I got, I got to keep that separation.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this was a determination I made early on when I started tapping into social media marketing, you know, 15 years ago was, you know, and I'm just going to keep two separate profiles.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to have a Facebook page for business.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to have a Facebook page for personal and I'm going to keep it separate.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, if something's relevant, I might drop something in there about, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: business stuff on the personal page if it's relevant, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: You always got to ask yourself, what is the context to this post?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it relevant before you post?
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, I appreciate everyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get some people up here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I might be a little slow on the draw here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm driving, so bear with me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to make sure I'm safety first.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let me get a couple of co-hosts up here as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you guys for being here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, let's jump over to Danielle.
[SPEAKER_04]: Danielle, good morning.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for joining us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's Christelle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I raised my hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, I'll co-host with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I've co-hosted like maybe twice, but you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this is the week I'm going to roll out my own little show here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I better start co-hosting and ride shotgun before I take the wheel, people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So can you imagine me on the wheel?
[SPEAKER_01]: How you guys doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know, non-negotiables, you know, I like what you were saying, you know, you're building the foundation with that new client and that face-to-face is irreplaceable.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: When that's an option, even if it's on Zoom or something, when you're looking at them and you're bonding, we got to add the
[SPEAKER_01]: Human element at all times, especially in an AI world, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It is what's going to differentiate the experience that the client has.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one of the first things I think about is is boundaries, you know, and.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not often easy to set the tone in the beginning because we want to, you know, go into, um, over pleasing because we want the security of the relationship.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that it's really important in the beginning to do that, you know, say no faster so that your yes actually stays powerful.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I've learned this the hard way and I continue on times going on crafting, you know, you didn't do what you know what you need to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after that, it's just, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, be adaptable.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in a really good streak right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I spent the weekend, and it was unplanned, and I think that's the beauty of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been having, I started writing a second book, I don't know, like before WTF even came out, at the suggestion of a book coach that I have, and I have been dragging it, and I'm meeting with him lunch tomorrow, and I thought, this is the first in-person meeting I'm having with him in a very long time, and I was like, write the damn book, Danielle.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had worked on what it would look like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have what we call in this world what I've been taught is the SFD done, the shitty first draft.
[SPEAKER_01]: The book is done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's, yeah, now it'll be tweaked like crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It won't be out for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you mentioned the word master, and that is my book's title, Master the Pivot, How Bold Leaders Turn Chaos Into Their Competitive Edge.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll see when we get that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's kind of exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, the non-negotiables are really about boundaries, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, if a relationship drains me, I recognize it's not the right one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And where I've changed this entrepreneurial journey is to recognize which clients are actually worth my time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So instead of me trying to prove my value all over the damn place, right, because we want to like build a company, we want to build a bank account, I am recognizing who isn't the right fit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm pulling away and not encouraging those relationships that I know are just not, I'm not going to serve well, or I'm going to spend a huge amount of time convincing what they need to do or how I do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to stay true to my brand, to my method.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to be adaptable because, you know, we open up our ears and our hearts and we learn more on how we can fine tune and perfect our business and our strategies.
[SPEAKER_01]: our position, but at the end of the day, not everybody is worth your time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, it's just not.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if it's not a good fit, release it to the universe there for somebody else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Danielle.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wonderful share this morning.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And congrats on, I love the name of the second book.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's, that's great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Love the word mastery in there and master.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, and yeah, like the, the non-negotiables versus,
[SPEAKER_04]: the other term you shared, what is it?
[SPEAKER_04]: The other term you shared.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boundaries.
[SPEAKER_04]: Boundaries, thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Boundaries.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, I was drawn to blank here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, boundaries are huge.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the quicker you can let people know your boundaries up front, the better, to your point, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And look, I'll just give you a perfect example.
[SPEAKER_04]: When it comes to your client relationships,
[SPEAKER_04]: if they're getting results, like you pretty much have like free reign.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, they could care less what your schedule is like.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't care.
[SPEAKER_04]: All they care about is results at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you're really having a great relationship and you're getting results and they're happy, man, everything is so much smoother.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so much smoother.
[SPEAKER_04]: And and I'm sure Christelle and Danielle and everyone
[SPEAKER_04]: that works with clients would agree with this, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, yeah, I think managing expectations is part of that, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's definitely part of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for, feel free to take the co-host invite I sent you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Would love to have you as co-host.
[SPEAKER_04]: That'd be awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Christelle, grab the co-host invite.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much, Daniel.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really enjoyed the share.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's jump over to Christelle.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, we can't hear Christelle, but yeah, back over to you, Daniel.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything else you want to add before we start going to the hands?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, one of the things, and this is becoming, and like, we all know this, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what's really becoming at the forefront of my mind, um, in terms of like, you know, gaining clients, and this is really coming from the, um, presentations I've been doing lately.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been, you know, very fortunate to have, um, the stage in, in a lot of, um, events.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, we know this, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to lead with storytelling, certainly in a presentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what kind of hooks people and it draws them in and it creates like
[SPEAKER_01]: something they get invested in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's the same approach when it comes to, you know, pitching a client, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, lead with a story, get them involved and then close with strategy, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody wants to hear all of our like high tune bullet points that we've like almost like quasi memorized, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there's just no like emotional component to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's gotta be that because that's what brings us back to connection.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would always say, you know, lead with a story and then, you know, close with a strategy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's all about alignment and, you know, authenticity, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It always comes down to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always think about like, how am I going to differentiate myself from an AI tool and relationship building?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, that's what I was going to say is, oh, she's not back.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's probably having some.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think she's got T-Mobile.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, Christelle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you've got to change whoever you have your thingy with.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: Every, every, you're talking about campaigns.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell us a little bit about when you think about campaigns.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I think about campaigns, I think about like ads and whatnot, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But that the importance of when I'm, let's say campaigning, that it's, it's more of a conversation than I would imagine it would be a commercial, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, going back to connection.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's back.
[SPEAKER_01]: She'd be in the speaker spot with her hand up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go, Christelle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, cause I have this dev meeting starting now that, you know, I'm, I'm here, but I'm like, I gotta now be in two places.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but hi everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: I assume you can hear me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_03]: X is killing me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not killing me, but.
[SPEAKER_03]: hurting my heart.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Happy Monday.
[SPEAKER_03]: Justin, that space on Saturday was so, so good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been thinking about it all weekend and it's like putting the fire I needed under my butt for the rest of the week.
[SPEAKER_03]: So y'all should definitely go back and listen to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just listen
[SPEAKER_03]: Listen to all of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're so good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Listen to everything that Danielle says.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't question any of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just soak it in and run with it, because she's amazing, and it's such an honor to be up here with you, co-hosting with you, and Andy as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Andy's my mentor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Justin, this mastermind is just getting better and better and better every day.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't say mini anymore, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: We dropped the mini masterclass.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's nothing mini about this.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is full grown, HD level, like the people in here, you know, John Carlos.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just got to let you know, Manus is taking my money.
[SPEAKER_03]: I finally got my credits renewed today.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like I got paid because, you know, I got all my Manus credits.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can start building agents again.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, who have I become?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm over here making Grok Imagine videos because of Ani.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you all didn't see the Justin inspired, you know, will work for AI credits, definitely check that out because that was so much fun to make.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was Justin's idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, and then Ani I had to add in there because she's over here like, you know, threatening Kevin if he doesn't sign up for Lovable because she needs her Lovable credits.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, it was a fun, fun weekend.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely had some core memories with Romeo.
[SPEAKER_03]: He got to ride a pony for the first time at this fall festival.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was adorable.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then also he got his first fish.
[SPEAKER_03]: His dad works seven days a week now, so he's doing the I'm-gonna-spoil-my-son-dad thing when I am around, which is really cute.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he got a new fish named Ricky.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yes, it's been great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Glad to be here with you all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really quickly, non-negotiables now have become
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're not at the emotional intelligence maturity level that I'm at or around it, I just simply will not be able to work with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't work with people who are not able to emotionally regulate themselves in a situation and work through problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's something I actually had to learn because I thought I was supposed to just make those relationships work, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: If they're clients, like you just kind of have to work with people.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, what I do is I have a community, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have a community that's open to all kinds of personalities and people.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't need to be
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, super emotionally regulated.
[SPEAKER_03]: But as far as the people that I'm spending one-on-one time with and that have the most access to me, those people have to, I told you all, my client said she spent six figures learning how to emotionally regulate and gain emotional intelligence.
[SPEAKER_03]: And those
[SPEAKER_03]: to the types of people I want to work with.
[SPEAKER_03]: So my non-negotiable is that if you can't handle yourself emotionally with me, especially as a man, because I work with a lot of men, and I really cannot work with a man that is gonna give me any sort of attitude problem in a way, or be aggressive with me at all, I just can't.
[SPEAKER_03]: I won't do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even wanna do that in a dating situation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why would I do that in any other situation?
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't pay me to talk.
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, rude to me, basically.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, that's my non-negotiable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just be nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, let's be nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's be kind to each other, respectful, and treat each other like adults and honor the relationship.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if we can do that, then we can do, you know, anything together.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, thank you, Christelle.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well said.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, glad you were able to make some great memories over the weekend with Romeo.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, that's a big one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, yeah, it all starts with respect, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Respect is, is everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, and yeah, like I understand as, as things progress, as relationships progress, especially in client situations, you know, you may have other team members that, um, you know, like to ruffle the feathers or fill in the blank.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in my experience,
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, sometimes I've even been put in situations where, you know, they, they respect my opinion so much.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're like, Hey, I need you to assess this person's skill sets to see if they're the right person for the team.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's the level of trust you end up developing with like leadership.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where they put that responsibility on you and they respect you so much.
[SPEAKER_04]: that they value your opinion to the point where it's like, you know, I have to be honest, like this person is not going to cut it for what they're building here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like this person does not have the acumen.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't have the business acumen.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't have the leadership quality, fill in the blank.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's, that's just reality.
[SPEAKER_04]: But think of the level of trust that you end up developing with the client or employer to have that type of pull.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's a big responsibility.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's a huge responsibility.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it happened a lot in my IT business too.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, you bring up some really great points there.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, when you're working with the high, you know, the top level, the CEO, the CFO, the CMO, when you're working at the high level, you know, they want you to make the hard decisions.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the difference.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: They want you to make the hard decisions.
[SPEAKER_04]: If they didn't want you to make the hard decisions, they wouldn't have brought you on board.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they'll tell you, they'll be like, yeah, Justin, I need you to give me it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Give me, give me the hard facts here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Give me the hard truth, Justin.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't, I don't want anything held back.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know, like when I have permission to do that, like I'm going to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't hold back.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the difference.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, but it takes years to get to that level.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like Andy, Danielle have that expertise, you know, Christelle has that expertise.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have that expertise.
[SPEAKER_04]: Many of you guys down below have that expertise.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it's, it's really a superpower being able to make those high level decisions that have a lot riding on the line.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, but yeah, let's let's check in with andy because he's on speaker panel Maybe he's able to share his intro real quick and then we'll continue the conversation andy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you available?
[SPEAKER_05]: I am for the next like 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah um what Because I what I didn't join right at the beginning Hit me with a question and i'll give you my response because I see the cool questions here.
[SPEAKER_05]: What are your non-negotiables?
[SPEAKER_05]: Campaign pro tips hit me.
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you what do you want to ask me today?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, what are some of your non-negotiables?
[SPEAKER_05]: Lying.
[SPEAKER_05]: Liar, liar, pants on fire, throw him down the fucking stairs.
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go, how about that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Lie to me, it's over.
[SPEAKER_05]: Tell me the truth, I will cover you, I will help you, I will got your back forever.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you tell me one thing, especially if you tell me one thing and tell somebody else something different, I want you off my team instantly, I don't give a fuck.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's over get out because how can you how can you go to battle with somebody when you don't know if they're telling you the truth?
[SPEAKER_05]: So last week I made a presentation to a big client And they need somebody to figure out to watch and cover over about 11 different projects And I said, okay cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_05]: I said here is the number one problem no matter who you get trust
[SPEAKER_05]: And what's going to happen is, as soon as the big management brings in a program manager to watch over the 11 projects, every single one of the 11 projects, project managers are going to be threatened.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're going to think, oh God, they're going to fire me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Why are they bringing this?
[SPEAKER_05]: Why do I have to answer to some new micromanaging boss?
[SPEAKER_05]: And I said, it's going to take six months before they even tell you anything the truth.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything's going to be filtered and kind of reality.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if your contracts cycle before now and then, you're going to have to just deal with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you need something for a longer play to create a better environment, fine.
[SPEAKER_05]: But just realize that the first six months of information is going to be 10% of the truth.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be the Instagram view of what's really happening, not the truth.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so non-negotiables for me are you have to push hard to get the truth today.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: All that's going to happen is you're going to embarrass people and they're going to feel threatened and then they're not going to tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they're going to just go into defensive mode.
[SPEAKER_05]: No matter what you try to accomplish, you're going to fail.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so one of my non-negotiables is truth and honesty.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there you go.
[SPEAKER_05]: And as far as campaigns go,
[SPEAKER_05]: I want everyone to understand this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Men and women think differently.
[SPEAKER_05]: They react to different inputs with different results.
[SPEAKER_05]: The same thing said to a man with a certain tone and the same thing said to a woman with a certain tone produce different results.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not good, not bad, just different.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are they capable?
[SPEAKER_05]: 100%, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are they more capable in certain areas?
[SPEAKER_05]: 100%, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the truth is you cannot just create one campaign and say, everybody's gonna get it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nope, uh-uh, sorry, no.
[SPEAKER_05]: What you have to do is pick your narrow niche, including the demographics, the gender, the
[SPEAKER_05]: age group, the socioeconomic status, the objective that the client wants.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when you pick that, then you can create a campaign that affects that individual, I call it ICP, your individual audience.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is why the first question I always ask everyone is, who's your audience?
[SPEAKER_05]: And then what is their problem you're serving?
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you're gonna build an app, you have to build an app that solves a problem for a specific group of people.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the reason is because you can't, I can't say a certain thing and have Danielle and Justin both respond exactly the same way because they're different people.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they are different parts of their life and they have different, all kinds of other different things.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so you can't create one campaign
[SPEAKER_05]: for everybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, if you listen to Gary Vee's book or read his book, Day Trading Attention, he talks about creating cohorts.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he creates his ideal customer profile, and then he creates cohorts inside that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if he's selling, and his example is, it's either yoga pants or yoga mats.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, selling yoga mats.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the way you sell yoga mats to ladies in Dallas,
[SPEAKER_05]: But in the you know, not dallas in this subsection in this area is different than you sell them to the girl to the ladies in You know alabama or houston or california or new york?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because they all kind of respond slightly differently to the to the cues to the information to what's being shared Gary v saying this right?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm, just repeating it
[SPEAKER_05]: The whole point is sub-cohort, break your niches down.
[SPEAKER_05]: You wanna be a campaign?
[SPEAKER_05]: Narrow down your niche.
[SPEAKER_05]: The more you narrow, the more you can target, the more you can talk directly to them in their language, the way that they have problems, the way that they'll respond.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, that's my one non-negotiable.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't lie to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: And number two is, who exactly is the audience?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, solid Andy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah a thousand percent agree with with those and Yeah, appreciate the Andy unfiltered this morning to get my Monday going.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, man Yeah, let's jump over to Danielle And I'm laughing And we got Andy unfiltered in the house for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what you have coming up in 30 minutes, but it's got you going I have to go I have to show up for jury duty and
[SPEAKER_05]: The last the last four big organizations that I've worked for ready Department of Corrections Department of Justice the Public and Safety Justice Department of a big the third largest county in the world and then The Judicial Council and I have to go to jury duty.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like do you really how long am I gonna last?
[SPEAKER_05]: They're like five seconds.
[SPEAKER_05]: Come on.
I
[SPEAKER_01]: Five seconds tops, but I'm having a visual, Andy, of me being on trial and you being in the box.
[SPEAKER_01]: a jury box.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't be like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's something about bald heads that can be scary.
[SPEAKER_01]: My husband, you know, I go, I love bald.
[SPEAKER_01]: My first husband bald, my second husband bald and by choice, you know, you shave it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most people are intimidated until they know the teddy bear underneath.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's just something very powerful and sometimes intimidating about that look.
[SPEAKER_01]: But,
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, Godspeed to you, you won't last long.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know it's an irritating drive for no reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you never know, they might pick you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Andy made a very important point.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I wanted to clarify something that used to throw me off.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, narrow down your niche, narrow down your niche, narrow down your niche.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was told that when I started coaching and what I was doing, and I was like, okay, I'm for the girls.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna be like a female, like just only I'm gonna just do females.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my podcast was only for women.
[SPEAKER_01]: Men would listen to it, but I only interviewed women.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm niching down, niching down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's the thing that I've learned about this, that there's a difference because he makes a very important point, but he calls it niching down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yoga mats are for everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: We probably, off the top of our head, think in that example, they're just for the ladies, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But no, there are plenty of men.
[SPEAKER_01]: really great athletes, top athletes doing, you know, understanding the importance of yoga.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's more about taking that same product, so whatever your product is, whatever it is that you're selling and servicing, and how are you pitching it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what you're really narrowed down and curating, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: know your audience, but yoga mats can be for everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: But where are you selling it?
[SPEAKER_01]: How people are going to like take that information, that commercial like pitch in Texas may look different than they would in Kansas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's really just like always at the forefront of your mind, know who you're talking to, because whatever it is that you're offering,
[SPEAKER_01]: can be for everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just for men and it's just not for women.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, certainly certain products out there are, we know this, but at its core, when we're niching down, you're really just, you're remaining adaptable to your storytelling component of it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The strategy can be the same, but who are you speaking to?
[SPEAKER_01]: Always know that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once you curate that and you can do that,
[SPEAKER_01]: then, you know, the world is your oyster, to tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so today I don't just coach women, I coach men and I'm comfortable in the male arena.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, first coming from law and then commercial real estate, both of which are heavily dominated by men.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just kind of what I grew up and I knew, and I'm kind of alpha by nature as a female.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when I speak to men and I'm coaching them, those aha moments, because Andy said, and then Justin said, and Christelle, men think differently than women.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't make it better or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just that we are wired differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the light bulbs that go off when I'm talking to men, because I'm thinking from an angle that I never even considered.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know when to do that, and I want to go back to what their what their language is so that I don't lose them in the process.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I just wanted to point that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, to add on to that, and then we'll go to Christelle and yeah, guys down below, feel free to like and repost the space and, you know, raise your hand if you want to contribute to the conversation here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'd love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely would love to hear from John Carlos, Jobfather, Adam and Kyle Elred.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just feel free to raise your hand, guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: So
[SPEAKER_04]: you mentioned, you know, the difference between men and women and really knowing like the, the five level languages book, I'm referencing that because yes, it's important for relationships, but also business relationships as well, because in the business space, you know, certain people will, uh, relate to, uh, for example, the personality of a CEO, for example, may be very, very data driven, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or maybe it's a female CEO and she's very emotional and she's all about people and relationships and she doesn't really care too much about data, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like you gotta understand their love language and how they interpret things and how best to approach it, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Approach conversations.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is really important because everyone is different, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: But you have to understand what can be relatable to them
[SPEAKER_04]: in their love language when it comes to business, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, just the basics that I can think of off the top of my head, because I'm a little distracted driving here, but you got to know what their love language is from a business standpoint.
[SPEAKER_04]: And some people it's really data, you know, logic, or, you know, emotion, they're more creative, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you just got to know what what that is.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, okay, over to you, Christelle, and then pass it to the people down below.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah this is such a good such a good topic because I recently had a huge revelation with the ICP and Andy helped me with this and it's transforming everything about how I'm thinking in my brand and my business and so it was confusing for me because here on X my audience is mostly men actually right so I was getting my ICP confused thinking that
[SPEAKER_03]: it's the people giving me the most attention or something, and that's absolutely not what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to look at it differently and say, where is, for me it was, where are the most valuable clients coming from?
[SPEAKER_03]: What is the thing that I'm doing that's attracting the best client, which I would define as the person who needs what I have and has the budget right now to pay for my most premium value offer?
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I looked at it, I don't see them here.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not here at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're on my newsletter, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe they met me on Clubhouse.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe they met me at a networking event.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, it's specifically Black women in their 50s and 60s that work in nonprofits.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're leaders.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're executive directors.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're board members.
[SPEAKER_03]: or they are just in general leaders of nonprofits, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: But if I get really, really specific, that's who it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I had to figure out the difference between who my audience is, the people that are consuming my content, the people that I'm, you know, interacting the most, that's my community.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is why it's so important to have community, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: But as far as my ICP, that's someone entirely different.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not here at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just not here at all, and I was confused why the disconnect was there, and now I understand.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so now I can go find them where they are, and that is LinkedIn, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or that is using tools like Apollo to not even, they're not even on LinkedIn, but I can get their email, I can get their phone number, I can find out where they are in Miami.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I can have a totally different strategy, but you first have to know who that is.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it makes sense, Danielle, the confusion, because I was very confused too.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I hope this helps.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like you got to first ask yourself, what's the goal?
[SPEAKER_03]: For me, the goal here on X is to build community.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yes, I'm going to speak to men and women.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna speak about technology.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna speak about Jesus.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are the things that build my community and network here.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I also have to figure out how to attract that ICP so I get more of the client that I'm looking for that's actually making my agency business.
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, run and grow and and scale.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, that was a huge epiphany for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope that helps.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, thanks.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like landing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't know how to land, but that's the land.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, Crystal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Meeting meeting your ICP where they're at.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, that's the takeaway I'm picking up from you.
[SPEAKER_04]: So.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I just add really quickly, Stel's point is really important because, you know, here's the thing, and I've seen people come and go and I've even flirted with the idea of like, why am I here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who am I going to coach to?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, is this my ICP people?
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know what this is, and specifically this space?
[SPEAKER_01]: and as well as Andy's and all the ones that Christelle hosts and visits.
[SPEAKER_01]: This to me, at the very least, is my gas station.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is where I fuel up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even if people don't like hire me here because they don't need me to do presentations and they're not hiring me for the keynote or the executive coaching, that that's that's not important.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is where I fuel up.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is where I get like my brainstorming, my energy, my momentum, my inspiration, my information.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I go and I implement it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So never abandon X.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't abandon the places that get you going because we need that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at the very least, this is a gas station and you never know who you run into and who's going to hire you next.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I just want to remind everybody and remind myself not to discount the importance of the spaces that we visit and that have started our journey and continue to fuel that journey.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where's the fuel from the WTF lady?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: WDF, where's the fuel?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's right here, guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's right here, okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: She's so good.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's so good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Man, well, thank you, Christelle, Danielle.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to get to these hands here, but I want to recognize a few people here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not driving anymore, so we're good now.
[SPEAKER_04]: So but I want to recognize a few people here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to go to John Carlos and, you know, John, father and Adam.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I want to recognize Kyle here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kyle, good to see you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice to connect with you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And and yeah, I would love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Feel free to, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Kyle, welcome.
[SPEAKER_04]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, good morning, everyone.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going well.
[SPEAKER_07]: I popped in a couple of times, but I never spoke yet.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I have a little bit more time on this Monday morning.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I stuck around for a little bit longer.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, the value that I've gotten from this so far has been great.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've already followed a few people and shot a few DMs out as well based on what people are doing.
[SPEAKER_07]: But just a quick introduction of myself.
[SPEAKER_07]: I live in New Jersey.
[SPEAKER_07]: I work with X on the advertising team.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I have been with, I've been with X for about four months.
[SPEAKER_07]: By the way, today's X is a three year anniversary.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you guys haven't seen that on X already, it's been already three years since Elon took over.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, but yeah, here to connect with people, network, um, get some value.
[SPEAKER_07]: One of my non-negotiables is.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a sales leadership background and enablement background as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: So one of my non-negotiables is.
[SPEAKER_07]: helping people that don't want to help themselves.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I pour into people, I get analytical, I mean, I get data driven.
[SPEAKER_07]: I really dig in and I really try to find out where people are, where they're trying to be, and then help them, you know, fill that gap.
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you don't want to help yourself, it kind of makes it really hard to want, you know, want to pour in into those types of people.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's what my non-negotiable is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks Kyle.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for tapping in here and grabbing the mic and yeah, great to connect with you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Gave you a follow back and
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm no stranger to X ads and, you know, campaigns and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, great, great, great to have you here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'd love to connect with you on the back channel on, uh, on maybe some collaborations.
[SPEAKER_04]: I worked with a few of your colleagues before on some campaigns and ads.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank, thank you, Kyle, for being here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Great to connect with you and yeah, like.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, great to have you in this room where we're all about, you know, sales marketing mastery here in the startup circle.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're all about, you know, empowering others, building their businesses, building their legacies.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we host daily spaces, you know, Monday through Friday, 6 45 AM Pacific.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, and yeah, these are just like daily masterminds.
[SPEAKER_04]: So all around business.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, but yeah, thanks for being here, Kyle.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, of course.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I just jump in real quick?
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want, I want, I want Kyle to know that I am a Jersey girl.
[SPEAKER_01]: I live in California now, but, um, you know, grew up, grew up in New Jersey.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when I looked at who you were just checking you out over here, um, you live in Roselle in New Jersey.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, um, my grandmother lived in Roselle park, I don't know, for 30 years, church, she lived in the rectory.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as soon as I saw that, I haven't seen Roselle and like, like, I don't even know the last time I saw somebody like, you know, saying that's exactly where they were and you just hit me in the heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I followed you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gotta tell you, I'm in love with you just because of where you're located.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll start there.
Um, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: You brought my grandmother who is like really honestly like the person in my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gone now I don't know 25 years, but I'm just I was like wow and you brought me immediately back decades and To a very very happy time in my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thanks for that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'm like I'm basically on the Roselle Park border just a couple streets down across Westfield have Five familiar with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it
[SPEAKER_04]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the serendipitous effects of x-faces here you guys like this is what it's all about.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah, let's let's go to John Carlos here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got about we're gonna go till 745 guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: So just plan accordingly that's not gonna be a super long space today, but Definitely want to get to these hands here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, let's go to John Carlos John Carlos.
[SPEAKER_04]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, good morning, Justin.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good morning, everybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good morning, Christelle.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm glad that you got your payday on Manus credits there.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's always a good thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Especially, I think they're still doing the double up on credits, so that's always nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and also, actually, I wanted to say a comment what Danielle said about Andy unfiltered.
[SPEAKER_06]: I agreed with that, and it's always nice to hear that energy come into the space.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got just four things here and then technically a fifth one, but the fifth one's kind of obvious if you guys know me, but I'm actually really, really big on privacy.
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe in privacy for the objective of safety, and that's more of a personal thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: That just kind of relates to Bitcoin and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I won't go too much into that, but you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Use your imagination.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then privacy for the objective of leverage, you know, I learned very early on, especially being autistic.
[SPEAKER_06]: In the very beginning, I used to actually hide that, and then it would kind of just come out because people would be like, man, that guy's off.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so there's trade offs, because I'm private about a lot of lot of things.
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's actually one of the things that I'm not private about, because it actually gives me leverage.
[SPEAKER_06]: because I know how to employ it and deploy it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So those are my two things in terms of privacy.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's almost like really one non-negotiable there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then leveraging AI to allocate my primary time to my family.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's definitely a personal non-negotiable now.
[SPEAKER_06]: If I can imagine how AI can either contribute or completely replace a task,
[SPEAKER_06]: sorry contribute to a task or completely replace the task.
[SPEAKER_06]: I engage in that in that theory and I try to bring it to application to the fullest extent possible because there's just I just see it as highway robbery at this point.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was listening to somebody this morning and basically if you learn how to save six hours a week using AI in your life you basically get a full day of time back into your month and
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, while that seems minuscule at a face value, it's actually, it's just not.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's an amazing thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And ever since, you know, when ChadGBT came out in November 2022, I think it was, at least when I started using it, you know, immediately I was using it for like three hours a day.
[SPEAKER_06]: And at that point I was running a kitchen in Austin.
[SPEAKER_06]: And one of the first things I did was, I was like, you know what, I don't want to do food cost anymore.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to outsource that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that kind of opened my eyes to everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so now I, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: short of breathing, sleeping, eating, and you know all the other stuff, I pass it on to AI first.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then of course there's review that I have to do.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't ever want to copy paste or just take it at face value.
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, get in the habit of arguing with your AI and just teaching it how to answer better.
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's a big personal non-negotiable.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then back to the business.
[SPEAKER_06]: I no longer work on things that don't bring me joy or advancement.
[SPEAKER_06]: If I don't immediately find joy in it or it doesn't advance me further, I don't pursue it.
[SPEAKER_06]: The money is not enough for me anymore.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, of course, the final one for me is, you know, I act with alignment of my values and decisions.
[SPEAKER_06]: If my decisions don't protect my values, then I don't make that decision.
[SPEAKER_06]: If I make decisions that are against my values, then at that point, I have to ask myself, what do I value?
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I do my best not to do that and not to put myself in that position.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's what clarity is all about.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to be aligned with your values.
[SPEAKER_06]: That way you can act accordingly and not self-sabotage your way down the road.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, you
[SPEAKER_06]: start Monday and you're like I value this objective here and then by Wednesday you've gotten distracted because of Tuesday's afternoon you know shenanigans and then Thursday morning you start slipping away from what your focus was to begin with.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I do my best to not engage in that habit anymore because I did a lot of that in my early 20s.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, those will be my non-negotiables.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to have boundaries with yourself.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to have boundaries with what you do, what you don't do, what you entertain, and all that good stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, great topic.
[SPEAKER_06]: Love to hear about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And one thing I do want to say real fast, man, Justin, I want to give Justin a shout out, if you don't mind here.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been extremely passive about this, but I do have a school community, and I've just been kind of,
[SPEAKER_06]: Little by little building that up.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's completely built actually, but as far as like, you know, how I want to build the community, so to speak, and that's what I've been kind of mulling over.
[SPEAKER_06]: So here's a formal announcement and a thank you actually to Justin because he's my first member there.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it is all going to be about clarity, cultivating clarity, whether it be in your personal or your business.
[SPEAKER_06]: And for the first 15 members I think I determined, you'll have a governing determination of how that grows and evolves.
[SPEAKER_06]: So obviously the name of the game is always going to be clarity as it relates to your life and your business.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm always interested in how can I actually extrapolate the best value and give that back to people.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just wanted to end with that, if you will.
[SPEAKER_06]: But thank you, Justin.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, no, thank you, John Carlos.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, great share.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, happy to support and look, I'm a student at the end of the day, guys, just like you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I'm no different.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, let me just be very clear here.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I need more clarity in my life.
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to stay laser focused on my goals, my visions, you know, my plans that I have a five year plan.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very clear.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very clear.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, and yeah, like I need, I need help with systems.
[SPEAKER_04]: I need help with clarity, continuous focus.
[SPEAKER_04]: I need, you know, someone like John Carlos who knows AI better than me to, you know, give his perspectives and, and advice.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that, that, that, that's, that's what it's all about is like, you have to be a lifelong learner.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and if you're a lifelong learner, then you're in the right room because that's what it's all about at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, I mean, I love the values, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: The values you hit on.
[SPEAKER_04]: If someone or something is not aligning with your values and it doesn't bring you joy, like I'm in the same boat, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I would love to get.
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, $250,000 a year CMO salary.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would love that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if the company doesn't align with my values, I'm not going to work with them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it just, it's very clear at this point, like I will not sacrifice my integrity and I will not sacrifice, you know, my values for money.
[SPEAKER_04]: I won't do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, if, and I've had plenty of opportunities, believe me, believe me, I've got, I got, you know, early on, I had a buddy I went to high school with multimillionaire now.
[SPEAKER_04]: and I had an opportunity to work with him and his company, and no, I didn't like the product.
[SPEAKER_04]: It didn't align with me, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: It didn't align.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd probably be doing really well right now, but the product didn't align with me, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: It didn't align with my values.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the point is, to John Carlos' point, is just make sure things align with your values and your integrity with yourself before the monetary gain.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the takeaway.
[SPEAKER_04]: And is it going to be a slower process?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, but it'll be more fulfilling, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll feel joy and you'll feel fulfilled and in alignment with who you are as a person, which to me, like that's everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to be able to sleep good at night, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to worry about, oh, wow, is this product going to get me in trouble or fill in the blank, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to worry about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, great, great points, John Carlos, that you brought up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it really resonated with me what you said.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, man, looking forward to the collaboration.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, like, you know, you've been hearing it, you know, for many months here, like John, John Carlos is the clarity coach, you know, like we deemed him that name, because, you know, he's very clear, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: He's very clear.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no, you know, there's no gray area.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like,
[SPEAKER_04]: You know and and so yeah, I appreciate you John Carlos and thanks for being a Ronin as well, man I really appreciate it and supporting the mission towards a thousand.
[SPEAKER_04]: So All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's jump over to Adam and then we're gonna go to aliboti and yeah Just keep it to like two minutes if you can guys because we're only got ten minutes left.
[SPEAKER_04]: So But yeah, Adam.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hope you're feeling better brother.
[SPEAKER_04]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_08]: Appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I'm captain concise.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll keep it short.
[SPEAKER_08]: I
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I'm feeling a little better.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just had a bunch of bunch of sicknesses all at once, which is just my luck.
[SPEAKER_08]: Good at this.
[SPEAKER_08]: But we were talking about the non-negotiables.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think, you know, you had mentioned not aligning with your values.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd say my time is
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, a non negotiable.
[SPEAKER_08]: If a client wants me to sit in there from like nine to five with no other reason, if I'm, you know, supervising a team, I get that.
[SPEAKER_08]: But if it's just like arbitrary amount of time they want me to spend that like tells me right off the bat, like not trusting they, they're not, you know, really smart cause they don't really know why you're sitting there from nine to five.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I just, uh,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, if we can't work it out beforehand, I'm not even going to bother with it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just going to refer them to Christelle.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, you know, keep it in house.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, but we have the, uh, campaign pro tips.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, yeah, just, uh, my, my mind's running with all these different things everybody's talking about.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, but I, I would say perplexity just came out with comet, which I don't know if anybody has tried it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I did link, uh, I have a link, you get a free month.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, in like the comment section, I love comment.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I really hated chat GPT when it was like, Hey, we'll be your, uh, search engine.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it just felt like I couldn't get to Google if I wanted to.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is bad-ass.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is like actually an assistant that like you can turn on and off.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, you know, and I, I say, Hey, send me a summary of all the emails at 8 AM every day.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I just got that sent to me at 8 in the morning today.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, wow, this is what it's supposed to be like.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not having to pull my hair out.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: And yeah, I linked it in the comments section.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I would check that out.
[SPEAKER_08]: That'd be my campaign pro tip.
[SPEAKER_04]: the
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I did see this on LinkedIn first, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we're all about being transparent and honest and integrity.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to put this out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, so I did see on LinkedIn first that there were some security concerns with the perplexity browser.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and so I saw that on LinkedIn, that's number one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Number two, I would do some extra due diligence as far as, uh, you know, just do your own due diligence.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you do your research?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because there, there has been identified.
[SPEAKER_04]: some critical security concerns with Perplexity's Comet browser.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just going to put that out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you do your own due diligence.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just putting it out there because I ran across it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is why, and I'm going to speak from experience now, when I installed the browser first, I don't fully authenticate everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, they want you to give up all your credentials and sync the browser activity from Chrome over to Perplexity, Comet.
[SPEAKER_04]: They want you to do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did not do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because of things like this that end up popping up, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So I take a very phased approach when I test my tech.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I'm just speaking from experience here.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys can do whatever you want.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just speaking from experience.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when I test a new tech, a new technology, a new software application, fill in the blank, I take a phased approach.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't go all in right at once.
[SPEAKER_04]: I take a very phase one, I'm going to install it and I'm going to start testing it, playing around with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then step two, then I'll be more forthcoming about some of the credentials that I share or authentications, etc.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just my approach, but I encourage everyone to do their own due diligence because this is definitely something we need to take into account as a lot of these new things come out very quickly,
[SPEAKER_04]: we're very forthcoming with our data, you know, very quickly, but I would just tread lightly because these types of things come up.
[SPEAKER_04]: So just want to put that out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm happy to hear any response back from you, Adam, on your thoughts, but, but yeah, just putting that out there for everyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, so, you know, where I stand.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Adam's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks again, Adam.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know who the next speaker was, but I would love to hear from Jobfather if you're available, Justin, for a minute or two.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, go for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: How's it going, man?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Justin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Giancarlos, Christel, Kyle, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Andy, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then my favorite voice on the Internet, Danielle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm always happy to be in the same room with you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: My non-negotiables.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually something I'm growing into, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't really had any until recently, when I finally, like Giancarlo said, it's not more so about the money anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more so about the type of clients I'm willing to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like lazy people, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I really do not like working with lazy people."
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you determine that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a set of rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just once I recognize it, I just don't deal with you, especially as a client.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to non-negotiables with clients, if you're nickel and diming me from the beginning, I just go ahead and tell you that I'm not the person for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I no longer try to prove my value.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't see the value in our first 15 minutes, then it's probably not valuable for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't work for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: because the clients that I am starting to get are executive level clients, word of mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those clients hop on the call and like, okay, what's the price?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, you need to be charging more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's just get it signed up right now and let's go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those clients don't bother me as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not calling me every five minutes about something I've already explained or put in writing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's my biggest non-negotiable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we only had a short time, but I'll keep it there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Surgery went well, recovering well, and just happy to be back on demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you guys for all the well wishes from anybody who was here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's a big distinction there, Justin, on the.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, that's gold right there, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to highlight that because that's really important.
[SPEAKER_04]: So as you increase the volume of prospects that you talk to and the clients that you work with,
[SPEAKER_04]: you develop this superpower.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that superpower is exactly what Justin described here, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So when you start talking to someone and collaborating with them in the first like 15 minutes, you can pretty much darn be sure that, oh, wow, this is going to work out well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or, oh, you know what, like, I see some areas for concern here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you got to be able to pick up on this.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to in the in the beginning, like when you're just starting out,
[SPEAKER_04]: you're not gonna be able to pick up on this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just part of this learned skill that you have to develop with working with clients and prospects.
[SPEAKER_04]: But once you learn it, it allows you to get very selective in who you do business with.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's absolutely critical.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't stress that point enough, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's been so many great things here, points shared today, but this is a big one.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a big one.
[SPEAKER_04]: So to Justin's point, the takeaway for everyone is,
[SPEAKER_04]: Look continuously continue to develop that skill of being able to pre qualify and disqualify people ahead of time before you take them on his clients it's just gonna be a much better.
[SPEAKER_04]: Working experience for you and and much better use of time for everyone and i even say this and i put it back on them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I say, for example, Hey, look, Jim, I appreciate your interest in wanting to work with me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Currently.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm only taking on clients at this budget right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so if that's not, you know, a thing that's feasible for you right now, totally understand.
[SPEAKER_04]: I totally get it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But this is where I'm at right now in my journey.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and, and that's, that's it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you're, you're doing it respectfully.
[SPEAKER_04]: You respect their time.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to respect your time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, and that's that's what it's about.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, thanks, Justin, for that reminder.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to go to final word now here, guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't believe it's it's been an hour already.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm shocked.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, we're going to start wrapping up the space right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I want to go to will real quickly and then, um, but yeah, Ellie read all the booty guys, please show up tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause, um, yeah, I'm on limited time today.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, but yeah, come back tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll get you on the space and we'll get you on the speaker panel.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, but yeah, we'll real quickly, we got two minutes left here where we're doing final word here.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been a, an amazing space and another great PhD level mastermind.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so yeah, we'll over to you, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Final word.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, first and final word, I hope everyone has a fantastic day.
[SPEAKER_09]: The new time zone we changed in the UK.
[SPEAKER_09]: So unfortunately, I have a conflict now between this space and the one that I run.
[SPEAKER_09]: But love everybody in the room.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hope you have a fantastic day.
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember that you are the opera in power.
[SPEAKER_09]: You are the one in charge of you.
[SPEAKER_09]: So go out there and smash it.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's my final word.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, Will.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, we're, we're a little slow on the time change here in California, so that won't be happening until November 2nd.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're a little slow here.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you know how we are in California zone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're a bit slower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, on purpose, Justin on purpose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going with that flow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Relaxed perhaps.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, not not in this space though.
[SPEAKER_04]: So All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well guys finally The reason is because that when Halloween is the end of this week and if the the time change used to be the same weekend and then That meant all the kids are walking around at the very beginning in the dark And so they changed it so that it's a week after Halloween.
[SPEAKER_05]: So none of the kids are
[SPEAKER_05]: they can do it at sunset instead of in the dark.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the reason why it got changed.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a legitimate reason why California decides to do different things.
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway, non-negotiables, you have to choose what they are for you, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Each one of us is different.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some people can accept a little bit of gray area.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm one of those guys that when I get put into the gray and I immediately try to move everything to the black or the white.
[SPEAKER_05]: Doesn't matter which way, just not this weird set of ambiguity.
[SPEAKER_05]: If I'm walking, I want to know it's in the light.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care if it's in the manure in the middle of the field.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm okay with that as long as it's in the light.
[SPEAKER_05]: But don't put me in the dark.
[SPEAKER_05]: Walk me through the manure and tell me that it's just soft and squishy because it's good for my feet.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't care about that anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, you guys have a great day.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll let you know what happens tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, and by the way, if I actually do get pulled on a jury, then there may not be a space this afternoon.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'll still try to do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, bye.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, thanks, Andy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Appreciate you, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, thanks for tapping in here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for your commitment to the movement here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, it doesn't go unrecognized.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Andy.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, Danielle, final word over to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So listening to everybody speak today, I would say that what I'm learning is that, you know, your business only grows at the speed of your boundaries, your clarity and your courage, right, to pivot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everything else is just noise.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got to silence the noise.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's, if it's not aligned, it's a distraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what I'm, what I'm really learning today is that the non-negotiables aren't so much like rules so much as guardrails.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that keeps my purpose from crashing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So WTF work that focus.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Work that focus.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Danielle.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, that final word, I'm going to clip that into a.
[SPEAKER_04]: a post because that was so good.
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you, Danielle, always.
[SPEAKER_04]: And thanks for co-hosting today.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, just great shares is always straight fire from you.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a lot of wisdom you're always dropping.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really appreciate it, Danielle.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, final word over to you, Crystal.
[SPEAKER_03]: So last week we were talking about Romeo's caca.
[SPEAKER_03]: This week we're talking about manure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess we're not going to get away from the poop talk.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm here for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am comfortable.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm here for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the space, Justin.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was another amazing one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Love Danielle as co-host.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's so amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: All of you are.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, Jobfather, what you just said about the nickel and diming, I'm done with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like,
[SPEAKER_03]: So here's my non-negotiable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have offers that are so good, like they are 10x the value of what you're charging so that when somebody comes to you and they complain about the price, you don't even wanna deal with them because you know that they just don't understand the value.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm happy to go answer a couple questions, but I'm not sending you testimonials, product samples, an agreement.
[SPEAKER_03]: a custom plan for my lowest ticket offer.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I have a landing page.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've talked three times on the phone.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all you're getting for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, if you're gonna pay me the big, big, big bucks, yeah, you're gonna get a couple more calls out of me.
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyways, let me not get on the soapbox.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is important.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just has to be a non-negotiable, but it has to start with you knowing that what you are offering is 10x
[SPEAKER_03]: what you're charging for it and beyond.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's innumerable, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's so good.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you make that your non-negotiable, then it's much easier to have the other boundaries that are really, really important.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it starts with you knowing that your stuff is good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yo shit don't stink, basically.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I'm done, thanks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_04]: Man you guys are cracking me up today, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_04]: See this is this is what it's all about guys We work hard we play harder.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, we work hard But we play harder and and just to reiterate some of my personal non-negotiables cuz I'll start with that Okay, I'll start with my personal non-negotiables family time comes first.
[SPEAKER_04]: I Sleep when exhausted required right authentic genuine relationships only
[SPEAKER_04]: and then I always balance my work modes between warrior mode and wizard mode, and loyalty when you commit fully.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's on the personal side.
[SPEAKER_04]: On the business side, revenue over vanity metrics.
[SPEAKER_04]: Revenue over vanity metrics.
[SPEAKER_04]: Data-driven decision-making only.
[SPEAKER_04]: Data-driven decision-making only.
[SPEAKER_04]: Strategic execution with discipline.
[SPEAKER_04]: and no fluff content or tactics and measurable ROI, return on investment on all activities, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are my non-negotiables on the personal side and the business side.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, hopefully you guys got some value today.
[SPEAKER_04]: Drop a comment.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a call to action here.
