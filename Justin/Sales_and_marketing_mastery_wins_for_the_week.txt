[SPEAKER_06]: Hey there, okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, we're gonna get everybody back, and we're gonna get everybody up here to speak, and we're gonna do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Justin's taking a walk in Carlsbad, and if the waves are high, then clearly the internet and connectivity isn't, so.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ah, there he is.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, all right, justin.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the waves are high and what the internet can't connect the cell phone service can't connect I mean, come on, what's up with that?
[SPEAKER_06]: We got to get vb and we got to get vb up here because he's been wanting to talk since the beginning So we got to get vb up here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, what's up?
[SPEAKER_06]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll stop i'll stop talking to mike.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm, sorry Everybody about the google ads like they're crushing it and look, you know you got to test google ads for
[SPEAKER_05]: your business, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is Alex Hermosi's big strategy, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like the way he was able to win was from paid ads, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: And I love paid ads.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm really good at it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I encourage everyone to run paid ads.
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, as long as you have an offer that converts organically, you've got to test it out with some paid ads, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can get started with as little as five to $10 a day.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not going to break the bank, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: But you got to test it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm continuously testing ads myself for my own products and services, my ebook, everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I highly encourage everyone to do it because that's the ultimate cheat code if you can nail that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, yeah, just having client wins like that is great.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm just in paid ads mode, just really leaning into that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you for the question, Christelle.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, guys, paid ads is what it's all about.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you got the AI ads powered platform now.
[SPEAKER_05]: that you can use.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, just really lean into it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where can we find that link?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I'm ready.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm ready to throw my money at this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got paid today.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah, I'll drop the link for you in the purple pill here.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can check it out.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, start because listen, once you once you master you know, these AI ads, like I'm telling you like,
[SPEAKER_05]: And you got to give it three months.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got to give it three months.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you can test with like five to $10 a day for three months, I'm telling you right now, it's going to be a game changer for you and your business.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, uh, but yeah, I'll drop the link for you, Christel.
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely check it out.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, and I didn't get any signups on the paid ads mastery course.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, I'm not, I'm not doing that right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just focusing on high ticket right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, but yeah, I mean, I'm, I'm, I'm promoting the platform because they're a sponsor.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it works and I use it and my clients use it and we're getting great results.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, uh, compared to running the ads.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, don't give up on that too soon.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to revive that because we need it.
[SPEAKER_04]: People just need the right messaging to understand why they need it and or get prepared.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can help prepare them with the type of offer that converts.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that can be a lead magnet.
[SPEAKER_04]: My pastor grew his email list by 1500 by running ads for a lead magnet, which was his free book.
[SPEAKER_04]: and about why Jesus, I think is what it was called.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they could download it for free and he got their email address.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you could also do it to promote your newsletter.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't even have to be an offer that converts, but also we can show people how to build an offer that converts because many of them need that too.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is great, I love it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, well said, Christelle.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, like 2026, I see a theme here, guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm all about themes and trends, as you know, we all should be.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know we all are, but I see a real big trend with paid ads in 2026.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, um, I'm going to be really leaning in hard on paid ads, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Really the top two tactics.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then BB, please raise your hand and come up here because you want to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and Andy, feel free to make me a cohost.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll, I'll press the buttons.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, yeah, like.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ads and email marketing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_05]: One, two punch right there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Paid ads and like, that's it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You focus on those two things for 90 days.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to be crushing it.
[SPEAKER_05]: As long as you have a offer that converts organically.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm hogging the mic enough.
[SPEAKER_05]: As I'm kind of in a, but all good.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're here.
[SPEAKER_05]: we're showing up.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Happy Friday.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go ahead, VB.
[SPEAKER_04]: Take it away.
[SPEAKER_04]: Take it away.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Christelle.
[SPEAKER_03]: A couple of points from the previous spaces, but thank you, Justin, for the space.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Andy, for rehosting the space.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wins for the week and then we can go back to the points.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wins for the week, basically not much.
[SPEAKER_03]: I failed a couple of times this week.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm traveling this week.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been traveling for the past three, four days, so I haven't been able to stick to my system, which is kind of... What?
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I use the right words?
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is kind of pissing off.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can't wake up at the right time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm here for a medical treatment in Chennai, so I've been traveling.
[SPEAKER_03]: Haven't been getting my workouts done, haven't been getting my, let's say, daily things done, like I had to post a thread today, I couldn't post it because certain things, life getting in the way.
[SPEAKER_03]: My product launch, which I was planning for November 30th, is hitting a bump because of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, it's failing, but I'm learning in the process.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to flip the switch and say that I'm learning.
[SPEAKER_03]: I learned a lot this week that, yes, life can get in the way, but you still got to show up.
[SPEAKER_03]: You still got to do your stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, one more thing is I'm realizing a couple of things that X is
[SPEAKER_03]: Filled with people who are either extremely nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an extreme place, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Extremely nice or there's no in between.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or absolute trolls.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there are other platforms.
[SPEAKER_03]: like sub stack let's assume right let's just say sub stack for right now because i have seen people who've just been uh consistent there for like three months and get a lot of subscribers and subscribers is the real audience guys i mean what if your ex gets taken away tomorrow um and stuff like that so i'm just i'm just caught in between am i spending a lot of energy on x uh should i just be uh
[SPEAKER_03]: hanging out here like 20% of the time, 30% of the time, but 70% of the time should I just be writing articles and posting newsletters and then being consistent on Substack?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kind of trying to make my decision on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But Justin is making a couple of good points about paid ads.
[SPEAKER_03]: and the kind of doubts that I was having in terms of my product.
[SPEAKER_03]: Would it succeed?
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't matter whether it gets immediate subscribers or buyers right away, but I'm sure if I take paid ads throughout, you know, $5 to $10 a day for like three months, I'm sure that'll happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's definitely in the cards for me once my product is launched.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I want to move back to what Crystal said yesterday about spaces not being subscribe only spaces.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, that's the point.
[SPEAKER_03]: My question is why not?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I know a lot of people like this guy from like Brock, Brock Pearson, if anybody over here knows him.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know there are a couple of employees from X who work in the X company itself who have subscribe only spaces and people are waiting for those spaces and trying to gain complete value from those spaces.
[SPEAKER_03]: Think about it guys, we were talking about pricing a couple of days ago and we were talking about how if you price a product high people are going to get more value from it because
[SPEAKER_03]: if it if it like irks them if it like pinches them a little bit they're going to pay full attention to either what your service is or they're going to completely utilize your product to the fullest because and if they utilize your product to the fullest they get more value from it right if we want to help our customer it just means that we should buy it but price it high right so why can't
[SPEAKER_03]: we follow the same logic when it comes to spaces is also my question because let's assume subscriber Justin puts a subscriber thing saying that okay three three dollars subscribe to me monthly right I pay three dollars that's absolutely fine I come to your space Justin hosts like once or thrice a week in the startup circle like I come to every subscriber space of his because number one I'm subscribed to him number two it's exclusive only to people who are subscribers so
[SPEAKER_03]: And also if he hosts for like an entire 60 minutes, I'm going to pay full attention for the 60 minutes, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever he says, I'm going to probably have a notebook right beside me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm probably going to jot it down.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to take complete, well, I mean.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm ready to answer when you want the answer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, that, and, um, about Andy's point about wearing black, um, only black,
[SPEAKER_03]: That is an absolute cheat code because I follow the same thing as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Black.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I used to go to office, but I don't anymore because I work from home for both my jobs.
[SPEAKER_03]: But black is the only color that I would go to.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not because of some Egypt story, but because I feel like I look good in black.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty much it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you probably look better than all of us, but that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: He looks better than me in black because I Wear black and I think that by default women are better looking than men But I do believe that men look best in black.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think everyone Looks great in black Yeah, well, that's because most of the time men wearing black are in tuxedos.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I
[SPEAKER_04]: No, not the men I see in black walking around with men.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just like a black t-shirt like you and Timo and VB are all wearing right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause that's what's in your BMP.
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually am wearing a black t-shirt.
[SPEAKER_06]: I really am.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty funny.
[SPEAKER_06]: But again, mine was all, it literally was just pure practicality.
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't any other reason, but then it evolved into,
[SPEAKER_06]: The whole thing happened because I was traveling.
[SPEAKER_06]: So my family was in California.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to Egypt and I was staying for two, three, four, six months at a time.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I wanted to just bring clothes, not have to go buy them or whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then it just kind of all worked together.
[SPEAKER_06]: I went and it works so well that I went from wearing
[SPEAKER_06]: From two suitcases and a carry-on bag to one suitcase and a carry-on bag and the one suitcase wasn't even full and I lived there for multiple years out of basically one suitcase and a carry-on bag.
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway.
[SPEAKER_06]: I see Chris is here First I'm gonna hop in if that's okay to answer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, please question.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so I love this question and I love this conversation I believe it's one of the most important that we can have because it comes down to the fundamentals of why we do what we do and the vision behind it which is so important and we don't get to talk about that enough and
[SPEAKER_04]: So first of all I want to say I am very very pro subscriber spaces and in general gated access points based on some monetary value.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't be more pro that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let me just put that out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I told Justin the other day I would love for you to have subscriber only spaces.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll be in any space that Justin hosts and
[SPEAKER_04]: most offers that he puts out, when I have the money for it, I'm going to buy it because he's just, you know, he's like, if it's a mall, I'm shopping at the Justin department store every time I come in.
[SPEAKER_04]: However, when it comes to these spaces, there's something very sacred about keeping community spaces free.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's something that you just can't get.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's value in both.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's extreme value in both.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to protect.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a very similar vision.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I started Community Spaces here on X, I'm not saying other people weren't doing Community Spaces, but I brought my community design branding with me to X. Justin was one of my first founders years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: What we've both seen is that the people, and this goes to what you started off saying, VP,
[SPEAKER_04]: The people who stay and they just do this out of service, like they come because they want to be in the community.
[SPEAKER_04]: They know they might get a client.
[SPEAKER_04]: They might get I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to get something.
[SPEAKER_04]: The people who just know that if you show up to a free space that's open to the public, it's open to anybody and you give and you give as much value, you don't gatekeep.
[SPEAKER_04]: We share everything, everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: We share the steps, the step by step.
[SPEAKER_04]: Justin shared his step-by-step content plan like that's money right there you know so when we do that and we've been doing it for years I've been doing it for four years Justin's been doing it for years the people who stick with it and don't give up because most people give up everyone feels at some point like you have felt
[SPEAKER_04]: Or you feel VB.
[SPEAKER_04]: I felt it too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Should I really be on X as much as I am?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this the right thing that I should be doing?
[SPEAKER_04]: And here's what it comes down to.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I'm happy with my client growth, I'm making the money that I want to make.
[SPEAKER_04]: And by the grace of God, I finally got in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to spend as much time on X as possible, because for me, X represents my playground.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's where my friends are.
[SPEAKER_04]: And my friends happen to be very, very smart.
[SPEAKER_04]: They happen to be great at business and sales and marketing and AI.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I have these weird friends that I hang out with at 4 p.m. that get me to talk about things I never thought I'd talk about on the Internet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's a whole other community that I'm a part of.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I come for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We really are here for the community and we trust and believe and have faith because we've seen the results over and over and over again, that if you do this, you will be rewarded far more than you could imagine what you put in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because like Justin reminds us, it starts with the service.
[SPEAKER_04]: It really does.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it goes into the profit and the revenue and all that comes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's that's my answer to that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't give up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Stay on X.
[SPEAKER_04]: The people that stay and keep doing it, they win.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't say this enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: The people that lose are the quitters.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't quit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just don't quit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you will win.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't not win if you stay consistent here.
[SPEAKER_04]: You do this.
[SPEAKER_04]: You show up to whatever spaces fill you and teach you how to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you keep doing it and you keep hosting and you keep serving and you will win.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, I'm done.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I know Timo's hand is up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to kind of respond to this, Timo, if you don't mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't get me wrong, Crystal.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not planning to give up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not one bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am in this journey to 100% in till the end of my time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am an established entrepreneur right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can call myself that because I do have people subscribing to my newsletters.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do have people getting my lead magnets.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am building towards a product.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is my journey.
[SPEAKER_03]: Entrepreneurship is my journey.
[SPEAKER_03]: Please don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just kind of contemplating because at this point in time, I'm delegating the certain stuff to I mean, I'm fortunate enough to to be having the freedom to work another job alongside this to afford somebody who can do my social media management on other platforms like YouTube and
[SPEAKER_03]: Instagram and Substack even at this point in time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have a couple subscribers on YouTube, Instagram, as well as Substack.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, the only conundrum I'm having at this point is, do I spend 100% of my time that I'm doing right now on X, or do I kind of pivot a little bit while I come into these spaces, of course, all the time, while I use X for its most important feature, which is, in my opinion, spaces.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, my other desire is to get a lot of subscribers, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, guys, I mean, today, by the way, I'm spending $100 on Claude.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how much Timo is spending.
[SPEAKER_03]: I switched to Claude from GPT because of Timo's advice, and it's working out great.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm spending $100 per month for Claude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Results are fantastic, however, Claude was,
[SPEAKER_02]: and a
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you prompting that much?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just asking because I am- Yeah, when I was, so when I was on the premium model, which is $17, it has a limitation of how much you can, how many kind of, how many prompts you can do per day, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Even the premium models.
[SPEAKER_03]: But for my, at this point in use, at this point, I think I use more than at least,
[SPEAKER_03]: 100 prompts a day.
[SPEAKER_03]: So premium model doesn't allow that.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, GPT premium model does allow, but GPT premium model also has limitations in how many screenshots you can post in one chat per day, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So that can, anyway, back to what I was saying.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Claude was under maintenance for about 30 minutes and I'm just like, dude,
[SPEAKER_03]: What's this?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it going to come back?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is my $100 lost?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, what do I got to do?
[SPEAKER_03]: But what if the same thing happens on X?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, guys, you guys have been in the journey for like two years, four years and have established yourself, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys have your subscribers.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, I'm still in the early stages at this point in time and I want to build my subscribers ASAP.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't want to be in this mindset
[SPEAKER_03]: What if X shuts down tomorrow, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I just have about 100 subscribers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I need 2000 subscribers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, that's my point here.
[SPEAKER_03]: But over to you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Justin, you're the host.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just take that, Mike.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, OK, Mike, coming around here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so I agree with everything Christelle was saying.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so what you got to focus on, VB, is growth.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, we would all want 2,000 subscribers on our email list right away.
[SPEAKER_05]: Who doesn't want that, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: But the challenge is, is you got to go through the growing pains of achieving 2,000, okay?
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, is there some things that can accelerate that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the main thing that you got to understand, and I'm understanding this as well, look, I only have like 300, you know, 330 subscribers on my email list, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Why?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I stopped for 15 years building my email list.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, so you just got to continue growing and that's going to take a bit longer.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's some things you can do to accelerate it, but the point is, is just stay consistent, even if it's weekly spaces that you're hosting, which you're starting to host like daily spaces as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, but yeah, is there other platforms you can experiment with?
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think where you're going to get the biggest growth from what you're building is on X and in there's other communities as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: that you can tap into on X.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, and then also offline channels, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Offline channels don't sleep on the offline stuff as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, but yeah, just stick with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just stick with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And as long as you're growing, that's the ultimate thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So is it slow?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are we impatient?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, myself included.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the point is, to Christelle's point here, just to hit it home,
[SPEAKER_05]: is look, I've been on this journey, entrepreneurial journey for over 25 years.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, 25 years, Andy longer than me.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm not stopping, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not gonna stop, I'm just gonna keep going.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just day by day, just keep going, don't stop.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, you'll have some accelerated months, you'll have some down months, that just is part of the game.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, just keep showing up, stay consistent,
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And look, you don't have failures.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't have, it's just lessons learned, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the mindset you need to have.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Look, I tried this.
[SPEAKER_05]: It didn't work.
[SPEAKER_05]: I do learn, grow, do learn, grow, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Do learn, grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do learn, grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: So hopefully that helps me, but yeah, stick with it, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when I was I'll make this super quick so we can get to the hands.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when I was referring to quitting earlier, I wasn't referring to quitting entrepreneurship.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can tell you are in your there's no quitting for you with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you have everything it takes and more.
[SPEAKER_04]: What I'm talking about is quitting X.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't quit X.
[SPEAKER_04]: People quit X all the time and then they come back.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like leaving you like you're married to the best.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, you're married to the best.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't go looking elsewhere because you're going to get burned.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not, it's not grass is greener on the other side.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the greenest grass because of spaces.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're bullish on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like we're bullish on out of everywhere on the internet, where can you build community and get the education and growth that you get on spaces?
[SPEAKER_04]: It does.
[SPEAKER_04]: I, you know, show me, tell me.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's what we're bullish on.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm just saying like, don't quit on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know there's the fear of a lots of things.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to have an email list.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're doing everything right.
[SPEAKER_04]: We understand that as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're big on the email list But in the meantime grow that email list and and just show up, you know, like don't quit on don't quit on us Don't quit on me, baby Sorry, okay Let's go to team up
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so Kristal, I set up the Beehive Mafia.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in Telegram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Currently me, Ani and Kevin are on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have a Telegram account, just give me a call.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three click mafia.
[SPEAKER_04]: Three click mafia.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can change it if you want, but just join it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get on with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know, Ani was telling me about Telegram yesterday.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why did you choose Telegram?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have to answer that right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say out of, well, it's a Russian product so I particularly don't like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: but because we share the longest border with them on one of the NATO countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, we're not like the biggest fans, but that dude is actually, it is actually pretty safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that, because that guy also is trying to save himself from the evil Kremlin army.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyways,
[SPEAKER_00]: We have that up, so if you want there, just let us know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Kristal, if you come, we can change it to Three Click Mafia, even though there, it's actually, it should be four clicks now because Ani has three ads running.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, dang.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's three clicks for us newbies, okay?
[SPEAKER_04]: Three clicks.
[SPEAKER_06]: You gotta add me to, add the Andy Unfiltered Beehive.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm using the, I'm using Beehive for my personal newsletter.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, add me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I will add you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have your telegram, so yeah, I'll add you there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to VB, I like what Chris was saying about X, but I kind of think it's...
[SPEAKER_00]: Andy, I think I'm getting some echo from you, Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, so being on AIX is kind of like being married with some like bipolar ketamine addict.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of like when it's good, it's fucking amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it sucks, it totally sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Currently, my posts are not going anywhere, but maybe they will.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really don't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: As for the subscribers,
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the reasons I didn't choose Substack, I do have a Substack account for the high stakes human skills, I have actually one article there too, but I switched to Beehive after testing out Substack because I didn't like
[SPEAKER_00]: the buttons and how it works and how it kind of limits things that Beehive doesn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that plus you don't own, you don't actually own the emails there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are just Substack users that you have linked to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And
[SPEAKER_00]: Being on Substack would then divert my... because it's an algorithm-based platform, that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as I do still work my 9-to-5 and I bring in the bulk of my revenue at the moment, I don't have the time and leisure of
[SPEAKER_00]: Just grinding out posts to multiple platforms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially on...
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want my piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll come on and post something on X.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I haven't been active because I've been building this content flywheel.
[SPEAKER_00]: From Beehive to X to YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I just double post everything on threads when I remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: And...
[SPEAKER_00]: The main reason we get, we meaning us beehivers, get more faster growth because we do recommend each other's newsletters.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is one of the best ways to gain people on the subscriber list.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also sanitate my list now, so I run automation that
[SPEAKER_00]: put people into funnels of saying goodbye if they're not opening their emails and thus keeping my subscriber list short.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it short more than just like random subscribers that randomly never open the emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I have my top dogs like all of the people here on the on the speaker panel, most of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like above 90% on open rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of them are really close on clicking all the links too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is reasons I prefer beehive and how to get them yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every follower you gain on X, go and look at their profile, pick something out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a follower, they give them a follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if not, just send them a DM, say thank you for the follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to learn more about me and you haven't visited my profile page, here is the link to my newsletter.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to learn more, I do long form content on my newsletter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that gives me, I don't know the percentage, but multiple subscribers per week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm up to 400 something right now, and I'm making
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm projected to make around 500 bucks from the ad revenue next month.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm the current average for October is $8 per email.
[SPEAKER_00]: So... Dang!
[SPEAKER_04]: Timo!
[SPEAKER_04]: Timo!
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, with a clap.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need all...
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm over here in my cheerleading like, give me a T. I M O.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually not, it's $8 per cent advertisement.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do two ads on email, so $16.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you all understand what that means?
[SPEAKER_04]: Every time Timo decides to write a newsletter to his audience, he automatically makes money.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I'm smiling so big.
[SPEAKER_04]: I told Justin yesterday, I said, Justin, can you please become?
[SPEAKER_04]: We're we're going to become beehive ads experts because that is the future.
[SPEAKER_04]: You all email marketing is still number one.
[SPEAKER_04]: It dominates.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, and Justin is talking about ads.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, guess what?
[SPEAKER_04]: Beehive is is becoming the master of.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is why we don't talk about kit because they're not doing this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't you know, I don't talk about subset.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm allergic to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm phobic.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm substack phobic.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: Put me in the category.
[SPEAKER_04]: I will anyways don't get me started on that because I'm here for love not hate Okay, I'm here for love not war sometimes So the point is please believe that ads in newsletters is the future of creator monetization
[SPEAKER_04]: period like if you listen to the founder of the ceo of beehive talking about their plan and get on his newsletter get on his line he's here on x right look at his content because he's doing some incredible things and he's a very smart man and he understands creator monetization and he understands the power
[SPEAKER_04]: of ads in newsletters.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I get Ani's newsletter, not only do I open it and read it, but I click on every single ad in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And guess what?
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes it's actually products that I try because they're aligned with the brand.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, I'll see a new AI tool.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, oh, you know, I'll try that.
[SPEAKER_04]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, go ahead, Justin, because I'm pumped about this future, like 2026, ads, creator monetization, newsletter, all coming together.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I just want to ask Timo a question for everyone so everyone can hear his answer.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Timo, how long did it take from when you started
[SPEAKER_05]: getting on the beehive to where you are now with that revenue.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I, and I remember, remember, remember rewind the clock.
[SPEAKER_05]: I told everyone the benchmark is a dollar per month per email user subscriber.
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember that I told everyone, I said, look, your benchmark is you need to be made dollar per month per email subscriber.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's your bench.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he hit a home run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is purely just the ad revenue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've done the, I have a premium paid plan, paid subscription that I now have gated emails for my OG founders and anyone who wants to join the pro plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is currently
[SPEAKER_00]: up to $500 this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the ad revenue, well, the MRR through the
[SPEAKER_00]: through the subscribers right now is somewhere around 40 bucks so that's basically keeping me afloat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It cost 49 dollars to subscribe to the scale plan and then the ad revenue plus I have an affiliate who is on a scale plan, Oni, and I'm getting 24 dollars
[SPEAKER_00]: monthly from her affiliate commission for the year so up to like I think I started getting them on June because he had she had a free month on May so so yeah I was I've been afloat like I've been on profit since the first month basically but for the ads to kick in that well I haven't been
[SPEAKER_00]: min-maxing on them but me and Kevin started really looking deep deep into this and started optimizing things and started optimizing the filtering and getting the
[SPEAKER_00]: just like brainstorming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's making four figures next month.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it just kind of hit us like, holy shit, you can actually scale this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know if you join the scale plan, you get into the slack community for beehivers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's so much great and basically free insight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even that slack group is worth the $49.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can just dive deep into there and see.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are making five figures out of the ad revenue alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're not like one million subscribers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I have 400 subscribers and like 430 or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I'm able to make 500 bucks from them out of the ad revenue alone, yeah, I'm golden.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you started in March, I think, and then here's the other revenue that Timo doesn't mention.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've shared revenue with him for the sponsorships as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't know if you guys know this, but yeah, because we have
[SPEAKER_05]: Sponsors, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got two sponsors.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he's gotten that revenue as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, dude Timo's a revenue machine He's a revenue machine guys, and he has a nine-to-five and he has daughters and daughters are extra demanding and he's going to their cheerleading game, you know not games, but
[SPEAKER_04]: competition no timo i you are the super star i'm giving you the student of the month for october student slash master teacher okay all of it because this is incredible and it's very inspiring and i hope people are listening and seeing that you can do it too timo has a full-time job and a family there's no excuses and it's not about super super growth i'm only at
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, like 1,400, but I know who those subscribers are.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I look at the emails, and I love what you're doing, Timo, that is so gangster.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, I'm putting you on a funnel to say bye.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I'm gonna start doing that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm just, it's cool because we're learning so much from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because the reality is that the plants on beehive, they grow when you, the payments grow when your account grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have three publications on my account.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have one tech, one that's kind of dormant and the startup circle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have three emails or newsletters on the one account, and they're closing in on hitting 1k.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means the next up to 2,500 is something like $10 more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a catastrophe.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I have 100 people who are not opening for three months,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm definitely sending them into a funnel that sends them three emails between a couple of days, between them that are saying, we're sorry to see that you're not opening the emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next one is going to be, I'm so, so, so sad.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to be kicked out soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the third one is you have been removed from the subscriptions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why do I love this so much?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm cracking up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you ever want to come back here's a button just click it and then drop your email and that's how that funnel does and it cleans automatically my list out of the inactives and I'm here to build you that if you just need to give me admin rights your new letter and I can do it in a couple of moments because I have now honed it down how to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, let's get to these hands.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm bursting.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have more questions, but let's let's get to the hand.
[SPEAKER_04]: So should we go to Will and then Chris?
[SPEAKER_04]: Justin, do you want to say anything before we go to Will?
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, let's go to Will.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just going to say Chris and his hand up for ages, if you want to go to Chris.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, let's go to Chris, but just let's go to a hand.
[SPEAKER_04]: Chris, please.
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you're good.
[SPEAKER_04]: We hear you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, Will, it is good hearing your refreshing accent this early in the morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really do appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just had a question for Justin because I came in at just the right time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just a little bit of background on me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a I'm a venture capitalist, but we also did something kind of crazy recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: We became what's called a merchant bank.
[SPEAKER_01]: where we can do venture capital, private equity and investment banking, like all in one swoop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's been very it's been a learning curve.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like a former military member.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like when they said you will learn banking, we hired a person from Goldman to teach him like, OK, well, you didn't ask me first.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we've been doing, because me and the other associates were actually like content creators like on our spare time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got 50K on TikTok.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just signed a brand deal with Traded BC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gary, he's a content creator on
[SPEAKER_01]: YouTube, he does private equity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't talk to him too much because that's kind of confusing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And pretty much our boss is like, okay, you will film our ads because while we just crushed our quota, we want people in Texas to know that if you're looking for like a $600 million debt deal, forget about regular banks, just deal with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I thought I heard you say like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can like do this ad spend pretty cheaply, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause like we all like, I just filmed like 12 ads with like, cause we all got our fancy cameras and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like what you just said is that the reach is pretty good even though you don't have to spend too much of that spend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that's very interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So great, great question, Chris.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good to see you again.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll make sure I DM you the link to the AI ads powered platform because here's why this is going to work for you guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: So,
[SPEAKER_05]: You already have user-generated content.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are the types of ads that work best when it's user-generated content, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's number one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Number two, you already have like a proven model.
[SPEAKER_05]: You already have buy-in from leadership.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just, yeah, spend five to $10 a day.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all testing in the beginning, but once you hit that one, that pops off, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Depending on your objective, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Which typically it's a progression, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Brand awareness, traffic, and then leads and sales, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't fast track it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't go straight to conversions.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can try.
[SPEAKER_05]: It can work.
[SPEAKER_05]: But in my experience, after running a thousand plus ads, you got to do brand awareness first traffic and then conversion and leads.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, and you got to give it three months.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so there's no better ad platform out there than the one that I'm using.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's called play, which is linked in the purple pill.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll send it to you.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then two other things you said is number one,
[SPEAKER_05]: Military.
[SPEAKER_05]: So why do military people make great entrepreneurs?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because they can follow a plan, they can follow strict guidelines, they're very disciplined, and they win in business.
[SPEAKER_05]: They win in business.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're great operators.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the other thing that you said which was really interesting is, yeah, venture capital, private equity.
[SPEAKER_05]: So,
[SPEAKER_05]: And for those of you who don't know what that is, essentially, it's money at scale, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Money at scale.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's the big play everyone aspires to.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you don't necessarily need venture capital and private equity these days with AI, but it's very attractive.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he got a brand deal.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if you guys picked up on that, but he got a brand deal.
[SPEAKER_05]: He got a brand deal.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, come on, like Chris is winning here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Chris is winning, okay?
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, hopefully that helps Chris.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll DM you the link, check it out.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm telling you, look, if you fast forward the clock from three months from now and you come back on to Space, I'm almost guaranteeing, I'm guaranteeing that you will have so much more success than you have now with your user generated content and your ads than you would natively running it on TikTok or,
[SPEAKER_05]: Facebook or Google without this tool.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all I'm going to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Any other follow ups?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, like I'll take a look because like also our capability on like the later states.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, once again, like I'm still learning because I didn't go to Wall Street, but they hired somebody to teach me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like we're targeting like because we because we also do what's called a debt structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we get to target now small businesses in the area like Texas, where I like where I live at.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where's a lot of HVAC that's trying to raise debt, obviously, because it's always hot here and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Small businesses, restaurants, we just closed a $300 million deal for the Central Park in Houston, which I was honored because I run there every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, why is nobody working on it?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, oh, nobody had the capital.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, cool, we gave you it now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this needs to be done in three months so I can stop running by all this construction.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, like getting like I've, when it comes to like small businesses, like ads and things like that, it's foreign, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I've only ever dealt with startups.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, that's gonna be a big help.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really do appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you got it, Chris.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me know if you have any follow-ups, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, thanks for grabbing the mic.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, keep up the great work with those brand deals and playing in that small business space with capital.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a big opportunity now that you got the user-generated content and the buy-in.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's time to scale.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's time to scale it up.
[SPEAKER_05]: And as far as cost per lead, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So cost per lead.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a metric, and these are the metrics everyone should care about, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Number one,
[SPEAKER_05]: is your cost per lead, right, your cost per lead.
[SPEAKER_05]: You want that down and as little as possible.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's not gonna come, you're not gonna launch an ad right off the bat in week one and have like great numbers because why?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because the system has to learn, it has to get some data to make a decision and to, you know, ideally optimize, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: We've been talking about optimize, just how Timo is optimizing his email list
[SPEAKER_05]: you optimize with ads as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the biggest mistake people make is they jump into the ads game and they're expecting instant gratification.
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't exist.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's why you give it three months, you'll be crushing it.
[SPEAKER_05]: VB, he wants 1,000 on his list.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not going to happen next week.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to take some time.
[SPEAKER_05]: You've got to give everything time, guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know we have limited time, but that's the biggest misconception when it comes to ads and list building, is people want instant gratification.
[SPEAKER_05]: The reality is, I'm dropping real talk.
[SPEAKER_04]: We love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We love Spicy Justin.
[SPEAKER_04]: We love Spicy Justin.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, the reality is there's no instant gratification.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got to give it three months.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I guarantee you, I guarantee you this is recorded.
[SPEAKER_05]: If Chris starts running these ads using this platform in three months from now, I'm telling you, he's going to have, he's going to have, well, our cost per lead is like five bucks, Justin.
[SPEAKER_05]: And wow, we've gotten, we've been blowing up and,
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we got so many more leads, and our cost per click is way down, and our click-through rate is way up, because we're doing user-generated content.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's getting traction in local markets.
[SPEAKER_05]: Businesses are talking about us.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going on TV shows.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is what's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm telling you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen it play out hundreds of times.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, this is what it's all about.
[SPEAKER_05]: So hopefully that helps.
[SPEAKER_05]: Chris, let me know if you have any follow-ups.
[SPEAKER_05]: And continue to optimize, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Optimize.
[SPEAKER_05]: Optimize, systemize, that's what it's all about.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just trolled your pinned post, Chris, because I saw you have a newsletter and I was going to go click on it and I saw it was a Substack link and I was like, oh, no, I don't know if I can do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I probably still will.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we do.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to warn you that if you if you keep hanging out with us and Justin committed to us for the next year.
[SPEAKER_04]: So these spaces do get addictive.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what you normally do during this time, but.
[SPEAKER_04]: you just might find yourself in this space.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you'll probably come to the beehive club at some point because that's that was one of the big themes for today was, yeah, monetize and grow through beehive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, show me the way to be honest, I spend most of my time on TikTok or YouTube, but I need to do a better job of a lot of the investing community hangs out on X in the form of trolling other people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's actually a good tactic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I need to spend more time on X.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, there's good news and bad news.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks, Chris, for coming.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're going to be back on Monday.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it is almost 8 o'clock.
[SPEAKER_06]: And my hosting duties are about to come to an end.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so let's go to Timo, Justin, Christel for some final words.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we'll shut her down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so another good one for the books.
[SPEAKER_00]: And always good to see people coming in.
