♪
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, good morning, good morning, good morning, my friends.
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome, welcome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome to another
[SPEAKER_06]: edition of the Revenue Ronin Community Space here, Sales and Marketing Mastery, your favorite topic, your favorite topic.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, welcome.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be a good one.
[SPEAKER_06]: And let me get some speaker requests up here.
[SPEAKER_06]: So awesome to have you guys here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good morning, Christelle.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good morning, Adam, Danielle, Vivi, Olivodi, Antonio.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good to see you guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hope you're doing well.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, let me get my awesome co-host Andy up here.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, so just trying to share real quickly, today is actually the Ronin Mastermind at 430 Pacific.
[SPEAKER_06]: So hopefully you'll see Christelle there and Danielle there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dan Ryan and Andy.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's about it as far as active members.
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll notice as you run communities, which again, just to rewind the clock for a second, I've built communities for companies, other brands, other thought leaders, big names.
[SPEAKER_06]: I built communities back in the day.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is the first community that I've built myself, which is the revenue Ronin community.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I've never built any, any community for myself.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, but you know, over two years ago, I got some coaching and, um, my buddy was telling me, he's like, yeah, Justin, it's time to build your own community.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's, it's time to build yours.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, and yeah, so, so here we are, you know, we've built the revenue Ronin community together.
[SPEAKER_06]: And a lot of it's inspired by Christelle as well, because, you know, she's modeled the way on, you know, what she's been doing in building for, for many years and, uh, starting off like, you know, her days in clubhouse, you know, so that she loves to share out.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, and yeah, we're community is a big part of building a business now.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just, it's mandatory.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not even optional.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's mandatory.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you're not building a community around your personal brand, your products and services, your company, you're gonna have a challenge.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're gonna have a challenge.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so, yeah, that's the hot take this morning.
[SPEAKER_06]: And just to reiterate, why MBA level?
[SPEAKER_06]: And now we're graduating to PhD as we go into 2026.
[SPEAKER_06]: The reason why is
[SPEAKER_06]: I used to call my videos and podcasts back in the day social media MBAs, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Social media MBAs.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have over 300 episodes and videos on this exact topic.
[SPEAKER_06]: Over 300, probably more.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the point is, you know, this has been on my heart.
[SPEAKER_06]: This has been on my mind.
[SPEAKER_06]: This has been, you know, part of my destiny for many years to be doing exactly what I'm doing right here today.
[SPEAKER_06]: And by the grace of God, I'm able to do that and have you guys join me every single morning, which I'm very thankful for.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, we just continue leveling up all together.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I appreciate everyone's time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Please like and repost the space.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be a good one.
[SPEAKER_06]: And before I go to my intros, and Christelle, if you wanted to co-host, throw me up a thumbs up if you want to co-host, if you're available.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, let me get Christelle up here.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, before I go over to intros, I want to share real quick another story about the MBA topic.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when I went to Cal State San Marcos, where I graduated... Is Justin rugging for you all or is that just me?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, he's rugging.
[SPEAKER_04]: Justin, you're rugging my guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're in rug city.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're back.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, um, getting back to my days at Cal state San Marcos.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I graduated 2009 and our senior experience group project was a lead generation campaign, believe it or not.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a lead generation campaign.
[SPEAKER_06]: And part of that project was me and my team decided to upsell.
[SPEAKER_06]: the, uh, the, the sponsor company for the senior experience project.
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically we become consultants for a company as part of our senior experience business project.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we became consultants and then I had the idea and I shared with the team.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, okay, guys, we're going to upsell them.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to get more money out of them to do a, uh, an outbound, uh, phone call campaign to coincide with this lead generation campaign that we were running for them.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they approved, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: They spent the money, they spent the extra money.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they paid the college and then I had them and me and my team had them spend more money to do an outbound phone call campaign to coincide with the lead gen campaign that we were doing.
[SPEAKER_06]: So long story short is like, this was like NBA level, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like majority of the projects of the classmates were, you know, just doing their research project or whatever, but they weren't upselling them.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this coincides where today's topic, because, you know, the topic is when, when to raise your prices, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: When to raise your prices.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is, this is a big topic and it's a very important one.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the point is from my college experience.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've just always been this way.
[SPEAKER_06]: If there, if there's an opportunity to upsell, you got to do it right.
[SPEAKER_06]: If it's going to get that much better performance and results from the campaign, you better believe you're going to have to upsell.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, that's what's been inspiring all these MBAs is I always think back to my college days when I upsold the company on a lead gen campaign, an outbound phone call campaign.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then they would pass over the leads to us and then we would close them, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like we would close them on the phone, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, this is MBA level.
[SPEAKER_06]: So welcome everybody, please like and repost this space.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a sponsored space, by the way.
[SPEAKER_06]: Our sponsor is Play.
[SPEAKER_06]: Play is an AI ads powered platform.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you're wanting to run ads on Facebook or Google or LinkedIn, you know, check out play the play platform.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll pin a link to the video.

[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for being here.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we got all abode.
[SPEAKER_06]: Joseph is back.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good to see you, Joseph.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, you've been crushing it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Really loving your shares.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, Antonio.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have Charlie Sue, I like that name, great to see you.
[SPEAKER_06]: And a few others down below.
[SPEAKER_06]: So welcome, please like and repost the space.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, let's go over to Andy and then we'll go to Christelle for quick intros before we get the topic going.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, and please raise your hands guys, we'll get you on stage.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we like to keep our shares to like, you know, two minutes max, three minutes maximum.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we can, you know, keep the mic going around and we can get to the shares of everyone.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, all right, Andy, good morning, welcome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, well, good morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, uh, price, um, is a very, very interesting and, uh, scary topic.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a million ways to look at it and a million different perspectives, except for the fact that I don't really care about everybody else's opinion unless they've actually done it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of my core tenants, hopefully you guys have either known this or are hearing it is that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't take advice from people who haven't done the thing they're advising me on, which also means I don't ever teach or try to give advice on things I've never done.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you notice when I talk about marketing, it's about how did I create something?
[SPEAKER_02]: How did this happen for me?
[SPEAKER_02]: So that you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: that I'm giving you not just academic advice, but I'm giving you experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, for example, I say, well, Alex Hermosi said you should do this thing because I've never done it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's like, well, you should do this thing, that means that I've done it and you should do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, I will give credit to wherever I got it from.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gary Vee, Alex Hermosi, Russell Brunson, Justin French, Justin Welch, Christelle, Danielle, whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so when is time to raise your prices now?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're providing value, raise your prices now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know you, and I've seen this, you know this, it's a very interesting, very true, and very old story.
[SPEAKER_02]: about the three bottles of wine, where the grocery store said, we have a wine tasting, there are three bottles, and they had no labels.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the first bottle said, this is a very inexpensive wine, but it has great, and then it gave you all the stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other one was like, this is a mid-priced wine, and then it gave a bunch of beautiful things about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then this one, ooh, this one, it's really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has pretty much the same kind of characteristics as the other ones, but it's just like way more expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And taste them and tell me which one you like the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: The most expensive one won.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: As you can imagine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Except for here's the twist.
[SPEAKER_02]: The twist is they were all the same bottle of wine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which means perception increases value.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which means if your prices are low, everybody thinks your prices are low.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I teased yesterday, or yeah yesterday, that
[SPEAKER_02]: I gave a presentation for a million dollar proposal.
[SPEAKER_02]: $250,000 a year for four years.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't heard back from them, but it was a million dollar proposal.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, roughly $20,000 a month, a little bit more, but you're, that's, you can do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's nothing stopping you from doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's nothing stopping you from doing it and then telling people about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It increases the value.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody goes, oh Andy's selling $20,000 a month services.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah and more Right go Okay It's not that big a deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a skill set.
[SPEAKER_02]: I Want to go into the leanness and I have a very specialized set of skills no
[SPEAKER_02]: Just go to my website, look up my website, look at all my clients, look at who I've done, look at how long I've done it for.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes sense, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing's stopping you from doing the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And by the way, I think my prices are too low.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, that's what the market is bearing right at the moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, increase your prices.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the bottom line.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes you more valuable.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Andy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very aspiring.
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, to see your journey and where you're at now.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, I mean, you're playing at a high level, especially with these government contracts, and that's a big niche to get into.
[SPEAKER_06]: I personally haven't played in that space, and it's been something I've looked at.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, I think for you, and I know you're probably looking at this already, but I've heard people talking about considering
[SPEAKER_06]: Providing services to government agencies around AI workflow and automation and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so with your skill sets, I think that'd be a good thing for you to explore as well, because you're very knowledgeable.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you're hosting a space for almost a year on the exact topic on business and AI.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, but yeah, I mean, you're, you're probably already thinking about this, but I just wanted to put it out there because I'm starting to see, you know, some people on Tik TOK, for example, they're talking about, yeah, you know, you can, I'm starting to talk to government agencies and get, you know, big contracts, um, and, and, and bid on contracts.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that's, you know, I thought of you, so, uh, well, but, but bid.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just to be clear, um, bidding and.
[SPEAKER_02]: and responding to RFPs, which is what I was doing, responding to an RFP.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those things, when they say, well, I'm bidding on this for government agencies, the agency has to say, if it's a public agency, anywhere in the United States, it has to say, I want this thing, and then ask everybody, it's gotta be a public, essentially, public marketplace.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's public funds.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't otherwise you get accused.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's all kinds of laws around that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what happens is they say Here's our presentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's what we need.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's what we're looking for and then if you qualify to supply services Then you can that that's that's all that's going on there, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not like I can just call up some of the people I know and go Hey, do you want to use this kind of thing?
[SPEAKER_02]: They go?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, like I
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's what we need.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't do it that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a very specific way you have to do processes and dollar values and stuff like that with government agencies.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just have to follow the rules.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, gotcha.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_06]: Definitely got to follow the rules on that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, but yeah, I mean, just wanted to share that with all my mind.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, but yeah, I mean, I think you're prime positioned and
[SPEAKER_06]: Everyone to highlight your point that you made about what what the market dictates Right as far as pricing goes because that's really important.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, I can't expect to charge You know five hundred thousand dollars a year for a CMO salary if the average CMO salary in San Diego is 250,000 wait, hold on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me Sorry, I want to jump in here, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's for public agencies for public money for private agencies.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can pay whatever they want.
I
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can charge whatever you want, as long as people want to buy it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, Myron Golden has a coaching service that's a million dollars a year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he has, like he said last time, he's got three people who pay him a million dollars a year to solve their problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: You totally can do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know he's not working full-time advising these people on a million dollars a year in consulting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember, it's about the
[SPEAKER_02]: Problems you're solving if you solve $10 an hour problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're gonna get paid $10 an hour for them if you solve million dollar problems You're gonna get paid more money to solve their million dollar problems because they've tried and have failed if you were trying to fix something and you have You get stuck
[SPEAKER_02]: You look for experts to fix it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're trying to do the, I mean, this is such a dumb example, but if you're trying to fix the sink and you go to Home Depot and you get the stuff, well, you're fixing the sink.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if the sink, you look at the sink and it's like shooting water out, you don't even know how to stop it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're calling the emergency plumber to bring out the thing and they're charging a couple hundred bucks an hour, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about skillset and urgency.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all I'm trying to say is, when do you raise your prices now?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you do that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Increase your skill set.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you want to increase it to a larger, higher value level, you simply have to choose, this is what I want to sell for a higher value.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you have to pick a path of what other value do I have to get or have?
[SPEAKER_02]: What skill set do I need to do or learn?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then what do I need to demonstrate that I've actually done so that people will hire me for that other value?
[SPEAKER_02]: You totally can do it, but in the public world, it's public and transparent and open, and therefore there are lots of rules around it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You still can work in it, but you just work in the rules that they have.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the public sector, you're selling to a bank.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are no rules about what software they can buy to put in a bank.
[SPEAKER_02]: or a manufacturing agency or a commercial real estate company.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no laws around what software you can or can't do.
[SPEAKER_02]: They only have laws and rules about what you have to comply with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any tool will help you comply.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, the point is, your services are helping people solve their problems, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: The bigger the problems you solve, the more money you can charge.
[SPEAKER_02]: End of story.
[SPEAKER_02]: Charge a lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, well said.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks, Andy, for the reframe.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Myron Golden, man, that's a... And look, coming from the personal development space, like I've seen a lot of people drop a lot of money on business coaching, life coaching, you know, events, etc.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, you know, the money's definitely there as long as the perceived value is there and the
[SPEAKER_06]: the need is there.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, let's go over to Christelle.
[SPEAKER_06]: Christelle, for your intro, good morning.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're right into live coaching.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know how we do it around here in these masterminds.
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't waste any time.
[SPEAKER_06]: We just get right to it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome, Christelle.
[SPEAKER_06]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, happy what's today?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it monday or tuesday tuesday?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's tuesday our favorite day the best day of the week And we don't even know what day it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: I started my day in a hitch slap space So I feel like I already got warmed up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Normally i'm warming up in here
[SPEAKER_04]: But no, you all are getting Christelle like warmed up, ready to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this conversation is already so good.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so good.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, you know, if we want more, we have to go where more is.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really it's that simple.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yet, you know, it does take
[SPEAKER_04]: improving your skills.
[SPEAKER_04]: It takes getting more results, getting better results, getting bigger results, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So that now you can prove, you can show, you have evidence, you have the receipts.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once you get those receipts, you get to go to the next level.
[SPEAKER_04]: And to me, the first receipt is, I was able to charge this amount for this result and I did it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm definitely going higher after that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't stay at the same price
[SPEAKER_04]: If somebody was willing to pay that price, we got the results.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I go higher because I got the results.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I charged them that price, I hadn't gotten them the results yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a promise of results.
[SPEAKER_04]: But once you give those results, you fulfilled on your promise and
[SPEAKER_04]: they're paying for more, oh, I'm definitely charging more every time for the same thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's, you know, I'm over here thinking about Marcus, my son's father, who's been working for Norwegian Cruise Line.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm learning so much from him about sales, because this is like the best sales job ever, ever, because his clients just have stupid money to spend.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't know about this luxury cruise world, but I'm about to know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your girl is about to know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going in December.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyone want to come with me?
[SPEAKER_04]: I literally have gotten people from church.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've gotten my sisters.
[SPEAKER_04]: If y'all want to come, it's just a few hundred dollars.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to the Bahamas, all inclusive.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: I put it inside Miami Global.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I have to do this because he tells me about this and he tells me how these people, they call and they're like, yeah, I want the biggest room.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want the penthouse.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and then my sister's going to call and my friend, they go in groups.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so these sales reps make, like some of them are making 30 to $60,000 a month.
[SPEAKER_04]: on selling cruises because the client is spending about $30,000 total, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you get one.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then just like me, think about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've brought my mother, my sister, a guy from church.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have another girlfriend.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've brought him, not just me, but four other deals, you see?
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like you got to be in the
[SPEAKER_04]: The business of people with money want what you have and they're gonna tell their people about it and be like, come and get it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whether that's a cruise line, whether it's the next automated workflow that you just save them hours a day on, whatever that is.
[SPEAKER_04]: But Justin, I just wanted to commend you because, you know, the way that you've grown this community is just, it melts my heart.
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes me feel so full as a human to just watch this from the very beginning because it's been such a beautiful model for people to see, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like we can talk about things all day.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when someone's able to see it, and many of us have been here from the beginning, so I just wanted to give you kudos and say I hope you all join the Revenue Ronin community because it's absolutely amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like if you think this is good, imagine what happens when we get on Zoom together, which is tonight.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope that I see you all there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as far as, you know, community goes, raise the prices once.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is what Justin has modeled as well, as he has
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, gotten certain levels of his community tiers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he said it like, look, it's going up.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the end of the summer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Price is going up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So as he gets more members in or as time goes on, he's raising the price because he know he's he is adding more and more value.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm at his his top tier right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if he put another tier in there, I'd probably join that one, you know, while I have the funds, because it's just again, imagine what you all get for him from him for free.
[SPEAKER_04]: Imagine what.
[SPEAKER_04]: I get what Andy gets, you know, what Danielle gets after the time we put in.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's one of my founders.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm one of his founders.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we also have, you know, a friendship that goes into it as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we get bonus calls.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm just saying invest in these relationships.
[SPEAKER_04]: because, yes, your price will be able to go up because you're more valuable, but also the value that you bring that's not monetary with these one-on-one or these small group connections are just very, very powerful.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a good little spiel for now.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have hands and I want to hear
[SPEAKER_04]: from some other people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for the co-host opportunity.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's always an honor to be up here with you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really learn so much, which is why I push my day.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, okay, Tuesday and Thursday, at least I can be in here because that dreaded dev meeting, which my client said, I could hear a little bit of annoyance in your voice.
[SPEAKER_04]: I totally understand.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been there too.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I said, thank you for making me aware.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yesterday I gave them
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, a little softer, humble, but I did let her know.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's annoying.
[SPEAKER_04]: I am annoyed because this is the most incompetent team I've ever seen, but I'm going to land there.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll talk about it more at the mastermind tonight.
[SPEAKER_04]: We know what my hot seat is going to be.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, thank you, Christo.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I listened to you a few minutes in the hitch slap space.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that was a great chair and I was driving and yeah, like competence and confidence, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like those are two, you know, key words that, you know, you need to
[SPEAKER_06]: navigate accordingly and and yeah like if you have the competence and the track record like there's no reason why you shouldn't have the confidence and shouldn't be charging more right and and it's all always a progression right it's always a progression you know so um it's not like we're we're we're we're fighting time to charge less like we're always charging more like that's the natural progression
[SPEAKER_06]: And as you stack your wins for your clients and for your, um, you know, your students and, and, you know, community members and stuff like that, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: You.
[SPEAKER_06]: you tell that story you tell those stories right and and you just continue charging more right like that that's that's what it's about at the end of the day um and so yeah like thanks thank you christelle great share and thanks for being a ronin and yeah you were one of the you were the first female ronin to sign up so thank you for being the first there and um and yeah let's jump over to danielle and then we'll go to vb and will so thanks guys for being here danielle over to you good morning
[SPEAKER_03]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know who else was watching the Dodgers game until like probably midnight.
[SPEAKER_03]: I literally, I bailed about, I don't know, four minutes before that guy hit a home run.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even watch the Dodgers.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I do love a game that's that heated and that's nuts.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I am tired.
[SPEAKER_03]: Such a good conversation you're bringing to the table.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I want to remind everybody here too, if you're not already,
[SPEAKER_03]: in the Ronin community, you're really missing out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, more than that, you might not feel like you're missing out because you get to attend this five days a week.
[SPEAKER_03]: I honestly, I joined that community before I was even going to want to participate in his masterminds and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was more about recognition and respect for what he delivers every single day.
[SPEAKER_03]: That alone should be the, go in at the lowest tier if you have to, but go in because if you're here consistently,
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, I think it's respectfully like owed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish X had had that option.
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyway, you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: When do you raise your prices?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, like the ideal world is that, you know, oh, well, now I'm too busy.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, so once the demand would outgrow the capacity that, you know, and there's a part of me in my head that was kind of waiting for that, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, historically, in corporate America, I was selling title insurance policies in the commercial real estate industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those prices were fixed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for me to go into this world, this is very new and I'm very young in my development on how I can do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, it's like, oh, you feel sorry for people.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then I'm giving Sally one price because I kind of know her.
[SPEAKER_03]: But Susan, the CEO in L.A., well, she get another price.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Danielle's all over the place.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have honestly struggled with this in the past year.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what I do know is that as soon as if I feel resentful instead of energized, I'm at the wrong price point.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I'm giving it away, then I'm not going to be able to sustain this business and grow it.
[SPEAKER_03]: My, I want to grow it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is the vision, which means hiring people under me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I cannot do that if I'm literally giving this half away.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what I've come to recognize is that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not about me lowering my prices, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like it's got to be a messaging problem for the people who are acting very interesting up until the point that they sign a contract and I get paid, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: If they're walking away, it's not about me dropping my price.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to keep my focus on its clarity.
[SPEAKER_03]: What messaging am I not delivering?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they're swimming around the boat.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not talking about people that I'm reaching and saying, oh, you need coaching.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're coming, and then some of them are not closing, even after they know what my charge, what the range is for the different tiers.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have to recognize, too, that
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't allow it to take like to make it personal, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you need to, you refine the offer until it hits a nerve.
[SPEAKER_03]: I look at what, what is going to make that person feel seen and heard and directly improved by what it is that I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, and you know, if you have to lower it, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was thinking about doing something, because you know, John, for you people that know, my husband's not at work for six weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to go on seven.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when he's not at work, he doesn't make money.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the kind of job he has.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a little bit of a pinch happening over in this household.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I thought, you know what, let me create a package and put it out for the first time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: But reducing my rate, not for the same package, a little bit of tweaks.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it doesn't look the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I'm not going to apologize for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I'm going to own it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't want to make it like it's a discount, you know, out of desperation, but more so it's, it's going to be a limited invitation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I want to position it like as an exclusive opportunity.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not a clearance sale, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we are not staying at these prices.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I do need to bump up business.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it'll be an invitation.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not a desperation.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your girl is a little tired.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm in for this hour.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I love you all.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, thank you, Daniel.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so we definitely I encourage three different price points.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I've always said this and I think it's it's it's worth noting.
[SPEAKER_06]: that you gotta have three different price points.
[SPEAKER_06]: You gotta always have your high ticket, your mid ticket, and your low ticket.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Daniel hit the nail on the head is you have to test your pricing with certain groups and see what resonates.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you really get some traction and they'll tell you, and it's all about having conversations with people you know, like, and trust and getting that feedback.
[SPEAKER_06]: And here's what will happen too, as a by-product of those conversations, some people will end up signing up with you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll just say, oh, and you don't ask them to sign up.
[SPEAKER_06]: What you do is you I'm wondering if I can get some feedback from you.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a key terminology, and I've done this and I've closed deals this way.
[SPEAKER_06]: You ask them for feedback.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, would you mind jumping on a quick 10, 15 minute call, Max?
[SPEAKER_06]: I know your time is worth $500 an hour, but I just want to jump on a quick 15 minute call with you just to get some quick feedback on something I'm working on.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, great.
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll jump on a call with you.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, you tell them what you're working on and you're like, well, typically, you know, this is what I charge, but I'm working on this special package right here.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a mid ticket offer.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's, you know, $2,500.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That seems like a great offer, Justin.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, is this live?
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I sign up for this?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's, it's ready to go.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll, I'll have everything finalized within the week.
[SPEAKER_06]: So.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I'll take down your information when it's ready.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll send you a text and you can sign up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, great.
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds good.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, this is the type of like building in public you got to do and be adaptable and you have to, you know, really lean into, you know, getting that feedback and you're subtly doing it right.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're subtly doing it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, it works.
[SPEAKER_06]: It works because I close deals this way and you can do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you have your high ticket, your mid ticket and your low ticket.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, just everyone should fit in one of those two buckets or three buckets.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if they don't, then no worries, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll continue showing up, getting value.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm trying to get everyone, even outside of X, onto spaces for questions.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I get so many questions in the DMs and so many questions from people outside of X that I'm just like, look, just go to a space and just ask a question.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, majority of the time they don't show up.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's a clear indicator.
[SPEAKER_06]: If somebody's showing up, like 80% of success is just showing up, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: If they're showing up, they're committed, they're interested, that speaks volumes.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the consistency part, if they're continuing to show up,
[SPEAKER_06]: That speaks volumes and now I have to share with you real quick.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this former colleague that I used to work with, you know, she saw my, you know, uptick on posting on on LinkedIn and we're connected on LinkedIn and I've been posting like sometimes three times a day.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Three times a day.
[SPEAKER_06]: My, my content output has like 20 X on LinkedIn and other channels.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so she DM me, she's like, Hey, I want to jump on a call with you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Boom, boom, boom.
[SPEAKER_06]: I walked her through.
[SPEAKER_06]: She's like, well, what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_06]: Caught up with her.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then she's like, wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: I need to send you a check for $250.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause I told her I charged $500 an hour.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, look, I charged $500 an hour.
[SPEAKER_06]: And she's like, wow, Justin.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're so tenacious.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, give me your address.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to send you, cause you just saved me so much time in this AI space.
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, because she's thinking about how she can find her way in A.I.
[SPEAKER_06]: and navigate that and carve out her niche.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I spent a half hour with her.
[SPEAKER_06]: I consulted her.
[SPEAKER_06]: I advised her based on where she was at.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then she found it so valuable.
[SPEAKER_06]: She's like, wow, that saved me like six months.
[SPEAKER_06]: So and again, if your products and services are saving people time, saving them money,
[SPEAKER_06]: making them more money or increasing their productivity, like you better believe that they're going to pay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because why would why would somebody, you know, want to waste like, you know, six months when they can join the Ronin community and then achieve in six months what they could in 90 days?
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a no brainer.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a no brainer.
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to accelerate your learning and you want to accelerate your your path towards success.
[SPEAKER_06]: quicker.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the only way you're going to do that is by working with a community that's going to help accelerate your growth.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, that's it.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the name of the game.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, let's get to these hands.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, go back over to Christelle, and then let's go to VB, and then we'd love to hear from Brooklyn and Will.
[SPEAKER_06]: and yeah just keep it to like two minutes guys if you can because we got a hard stop at 7 45 but um but yeah we're getting to be a full room here so thanks guys so much for being here okay over to you crystal
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, this is going to be quick because I forgot what I wanted to say, which is fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll come back to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to hear from these hands anyway.
[SPEAKER_04]: But also, I got to say, I'm over here like I'm ready to change my price, like I'm ready to change my price, because when I think about it, I really am more at five hundred dollars an hour because that's the price that I'm charging to get like, you know, the best result for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this 250, I'm already starting to get tired of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, I feel like this space is actually going to push me to that next level that I need to be at because the amount of time I'm giving to these clients that are paying a lot more money, right, because now I'm in the $15,000 for three months, that's my highest range right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: So because of that $250,000 doesn't feel worth my time for an hour.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd much rather say, look,
[SPEAKER_04]: I charge $500 an hour, but you're going to get a lot from me because it's not just my hour of time.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's what I'm doing and what the Ava's are doing with that hour of time, because we take that transcript and we make magic with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we can like build a whole business with an hour of just asking you the right questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's basically what I'm doing for that hour.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just asking questions, asking questions and then taking the answers and turning it into something, whether it's a newsletter, a content plan, a
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, vision board, brand profile.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's so much you can do.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is a business model anyone can do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyone can do.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can charge $500 an hour for it and give them an amazing result.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they're going to want to pay you for everything that you do.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's why we need to learn the skills.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to learn how to use lovable.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care if you don't like lovable.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't want to be a vibe coder.
[SPEAKER_04]: It rubs you the wrong way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Learn how to use it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do something like make a pretend app with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: so that you can charge other people to show them how to use it or build something for them.
[SPEAKER_04]: These tools are so important.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I'm off the soapbox.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get to the hands, but yeah, it's so good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, thanks, Christelle.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, because, yeah, I mean, I'm going to be raising my prices to like, you know, now, I mean, I'm not going to wait till the end.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to wait till, you know, 2026 to like raise my prices.
[SPEAKER_06]: But no, I mean, I'm going to do it now, like starting in November, like I'm going to raise my prices and, you know, I'll start attracting a different caliber of, you know, clients for the agency and, you know, members for the Ronin community and fill in the blank.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like it creates great momentum.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Justin, I'm so sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's so important.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys write down the feedback thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's that's what it was.
[SPEAKER_04]: That feedback point that Justin just said is so like it gets results.
[SPEAKER_04]: It gets results.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's proven.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's what Rusted Russ went around and got to get feedback on his app.
[SPEAKER_04]: And people, including me, were frustrated that we couldn't throw money at him on the call.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've done this twice now.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the pro tip.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've done this twice now at networking events where you get a hot seat.
[SPEAKER_04]: People don't take these hot seats.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't understand.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're paying to be a part of this networking community.
[SPEAKER_04]: You get a hot seat.
[SPEAKER_04]: You get five minutes to talk about your business in some way and you don't take it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I take it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I sit back.
[SPEAKER_04]: I stay quiet.
[SPEAKER_04]: I let people volunteer.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if they don't jump into the hot seat, I'm jumping in.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've done this twice now.
[SPEAKER_04]: and the hot seat, you have to ask for feedback.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I can't go in there shilling and talking about what I do, and I'm so glad, because what I do instead is I ask for feedback about what my offer is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey guys, I'm building this offer for newsletters, $500, and we're gonna get your whole newsletter system going in Beehive.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want some feedback because I feel like people aren't starting their newsletters, so I would just love to know
[SPEAKER_04]: why, you know, can you give me feedback on why you haven't started your newsletter?"
[SPEAKER_04]: And this woman literally texts me and she's like, you're genius.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know exactly what you're doing right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it works.
[SPEAKER_04]: I get calls afterwards.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got like two sales calls set up.
[SPEAKER_04]: This one guy wants to like, you know, have me help him.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the craziest thing, but I just need y'all to know the feedback thing works.
[SPEAKER_04]: And here's the thing, we need to be getting feedback on our offers anyways.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, this is something we need to be doing anyways, besides the fact that it's an amazing sales strategy.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just the bonus.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, it's really just the bonus.
[SPEAKER_04]: But please get the feedback.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I'm about to do this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know what I'm going to do, Justin?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm really landing here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Please excuse me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to, my new rate is 500, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: But what I'm gonna do is go back to those people that are lingering and be like, look, you got three days to get me at 250, okay?
[SPEAKER_04]: And then my price goes up after this dreaded holiday is over and we start celebrating the birth of Jesus.
[SPEAKER_04]: On November 1st, your girl is doubling her price, okay?
[SPEAKER_04]: So you got, that's what I'm gonna do, serious.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I hope y'all take this and run with it, like do this.
[SPEAKER_04]: It works, people, it works.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, that's all, thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's, yeah, no worries, Christelle, all good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, like these are the three Fs that you need, like this is it right here, guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, feedback, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're not selling, you're getting feedback, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I've been,
[SPEAKER_06]: teaching this for over a year, two years now.
[SPEAKER_06]: So feedback, and then follow up, and then follow through.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the process, that's the system, that's the framework.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's you ask for feedback, you follow up, hey, I know we had a call last week, you seem interested, just wanted to follow up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, um, you know, I'm not quite ready right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: No worries, you know, but and and what Christelle needs to do as a pro tip is she needs to text them.
[SPEAKER_06]: She needs to call them and she needs to email them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right and ideally multiple emails where it's like, okay, three days left.
[SPEAKER_06]: two days left, one day left, and then it's like, all right, final day.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the this is the four day cash machine formula that I've taught.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's a series of four emails where it's like, you know, value and then a subtle call to action.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the call to action gets more stronger towards the final day, you know, last chance that it's, you know, hard selling on the final email.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then it gives them that opportunity to sign up like that's it.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's I've made so much money.
[SPEAKER_06]: For others using this formula I've I've I've done it for myself for some offers as well it works it generates revenue so yeah definitely try it out for yourself I know even.
[SPEAKER_06]: our good friend Janina she tried it out and she made she made a sale or maybe a couple sales so it works it works so thank you for that reminder Christelle let's go to VB and then Will and then we're gonna go to Brooklyn but yeah just keep it to like two minutes if you can guys really appreciate it I got a hard stop at 745 so but yeah VB really enjoyed your space today and you know I used to not be a morning person VB but I forced myself to become a morning person why because
[SPEAKER_06]: I just forced myself like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's nothing else to it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I'm traditionally a night owl.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just had to force myself to become a morning person.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I didn't I didn't skip on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just went all in.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so now I've become a morning person.
[SPEAKER_06]: These last like four or five years.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So over to you, Vivi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Justin, you're very kind to say your words about my space.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I wish you could host sooner, though, because this is where this is really, really close to my bedtime and speaking on spaces actually gets my adrenaline or whatever pumping.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after the space, I'm like 30 minutes just thinking about it or just wandering around here and there instead of actually falling asleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wish you could host sooner.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway,
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would love to be a part of your own and community.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've I think I've definitely would at one point in my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at this point in time, I just feel like I'm moving towards this product launch as well as I'm working another job.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like two jobs for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure if I could give the time commitment or the at this point in time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the middle ground is just and I really hope you get
[SPEAKER_01]: accepted or through with the x subscription whatever it is cost because see your spaces are really informative no doubt about that and the people who join these spaces as well your space is high class right top information being spread around here it needs to be
[SPEAKER_01]: a subscription only space.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I hope one day you reach the X subscription or you get eligible so that your space becomes a subscription subscribers only space and I would definitely subscribe for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah now moving on in terms of the subject matter at hand quite a lot of things that we spoke about but
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to charge my, I was going to start with the low ticket.
[SPEAKER_01]: You always talk about low ticket, mid ticket and high ticket.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I was going to start with my low ticket because I thought that's a safe point.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then after reading 100 Million Offers by Hermosi, my perspective completely shifted.
[SPEAKER_01]: I realized I need to charge higher and I took a little bit of points that I can use for my product.
[SPEAKER_01]: which I'm going to kind of mention over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Firstly, you all were talking about increasing your prices, which just reminds me of a point that Hormozi made in his book, that yes, you definitely have to increase your prices.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, before increasing your prices, it is always a necessity to announce it to your audience that your prices are going to be increased.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're not going to increase your prices just for the same version of your product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe your product or service was a version one of your service, but now it's a version two of your service, perhaps.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to product route, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So in my head, the version two of my product can be the first hundred,
[SPEAKER_01]: or the next 100 buyers of my product get a free get 12 one on one sessions with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my version two.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then you increase your price.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, the base product says the same base services the same, but then you just add it in one more layer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it allows you to increase your price.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yes, he says, always tell your audience that you are going to be increasing your prices.
[SPEAKER_01]: and of course when you increase your price it's good for your audience especially you have to increase your price as as much as you possibly can so that it kind of pinches your clients a little bit that they have to pay for it because if it pricks them a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: you know that they will put in the effort to complete the product or the service with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they complete the product or service with you, of course, they're going to get value out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas if they don't, if it's a low price thing, they're not going to complete it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just going to be like, it's there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they don't get value out of it, which means they don't recommend you to their friends or family, or they don't come back to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So definitely high prices, valuable AF, which is why I've moved up from actually charging, going for a low ticket to what I consider a high ticket at this point in time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to mention the price, of course, maybe in the later on stages, but what I consider to be high ticket at this point in time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, when you, of course, increase your price,
[SPEAKER_01]: absolutely please go ahead and increase it however now the pressure is on me that i have to deliver value right when you increase your price of course you can be perceived as okay this product has something else inside it but what if it doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: What if it doesn't have enough value?
[SPEAKER_01]: Value equals outcome into likelihood of achievement divided by time delay into effort and sacrifice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean what if I don't deliver that much value?
[SPEAKER_01]: So of course you put in that time and make sure that you deliver and when you deliver
[SPEAKER_01]: you get recommended word of mouth spreads faster and that's the best kind of marketing in my eyes so put in your time to create a valuable offer and price it as high as possible add in bonuses and guarantees to your offer which is what is going to make it more unique than other people's offer because you both might have the same offers same product or same service but your bonuses and guarantees
[SPEAKER_01]: will make a difference in my eyes.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot more points, but I think I don't want to, it's been more than 90, 120 seconds, but wonderful to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Justin, I wish you could host sooner, but it's always fun to be here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, thanks, VB.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I mean, I wish I could host sooner, but yeah, it's just like, this is the slot and, you know, best I can do here.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the time change will be better, though, because
[SPEAKER_06]: Once November 2nd hits, we change back the clock.
[SPEAKER_06]: So hopefully that should accommodate for you.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, I mean, and thank you for the kind words.
[SPEAKER_06]: We really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, like you always got to start with your high ticket.
[SPEAKER_06]: I always start with high ticket.
[SPEAKER_06]: And let's just be honest and point out the elephant in the room.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're not going to get a lot of high ticket clients in X these X streets.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, there's a lot of venture capitalists out here.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of investors, business owners, people doing really well on here.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can see him and that's great.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you know, my ICP is not on X, right there on LinkedIn or there, you know, in a networking group locally here in San Diego or their biotech startup, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like they're not on X spaces.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I'm just going to point out the obvious, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: You know that's okay but at the same time you need to remember the fundamentals which is you know like Christelle you know she she got her high ticket client recently from her email list right who had been on her email list for like over a year or two years so the point is is like.
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, find out where your ICP is for your high ticket and and maybe there's a high ticket for X, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's, you know, that fits your ICP.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So and I think we'll may have some, you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: people from X that have his ICP.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I should take that back.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there is some ICPs for the running community on X, but for my agency and fractional CMO services, not that many, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: There's not that many because my high ticket is $30,000 for 90 days, but I guarantee transformation.
[SPEAKER_06]: I guarantee return on investment and they have to qualify.
[SPEAKER_06]: right like that's my guarantee so uh but yeah appreciate the share vb and um and yeah like always start with the high ticket and then go down to your mid ticket and then low ticket and uh and yeah that's the progression that i've been doing and i encourage others to do as well so all right over to you will how's it going man
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Justin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going well, thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Loving the conversation so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: The time is a little bit off for me as well here in the UK, because we just had our clocks back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the initial space clashes, but I was glad I was able to make it in before you guys finished today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is actually a really interesting topic, because Andy, you might be on this as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm basically making a paid tier in my community today, later today, 100 bucks a month, as we've talked about, Justin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been thinking a lot about what it means to
[SPEAKER_00]: provide more in use value that I'm taking in cash value, because that's my guiding star.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give more in use than you take in cash, then you are happy to set the price.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this has been on my mind, and it's a really good time to say this, because as you know, I've been maybe too transparent with my pricing since I started on X.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my high ticket, reasonably high, it's not as high as Justin's level, is 2,500 pounds now, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it went from, I started at $1,500, then I went to $1,850, then $2,000, $2,250, $2,000, and then I started at $2,500 for 12 weeks of identity coaching, which is confidence, which is helping people, helping solopreneurs who
[SPEAKER_00]: know what to do, but they're having trouble doing it because of a lack of internal congruence, solving that problem so they can have more revenue like Justin does, but also have more confidence to actually go and pursue clients and actually live that the life that they want to live because many people are holding themselves back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I noticed, Justin, was this is kind of where my internal limit was up until maybe a few weeks, maybe about a month or two ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I felt like I couldn't charge more than
[SPEAKER_00]: $2,500 for 12 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was actually something that was really baffling me because I knew transformation, as you know, is worth the amount that the person can get out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that was really interesting to me was when I thought about putting the price up to the next level, which was $3,000, I really didn't think that
[SPEAKER_00]: But the ICP that I had in mind was right for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And something Andy said the other day was, aim for a different crowd.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that really got me thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because yeah, the average solopreneur really would max their budget for personal development slash coaching at about $2,500 if they're bringing in $10k a month or in that range.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I've been doing lately is thinking about pivoting to other channels for the high ticket offer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I actually, as it's a Ronin space, wanted to throw it back to you and Andy to get some feedback on that, if possible.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Andy, do you want to go ahead before I go?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, first of all, thank you for the idea that what we say matters and helps people, so thank you for that, Will.
[SPEAKER_02]: Change your ICP, change your pricing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it does seem simple, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: A company makes a lot of money selling Rolls Royces and Land Rovers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another company makes a lot of money selling low-end commuter cars.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all cars, they all go on the road.
[SPEAKER_02]: Different people buy them though, that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's no difference between LaCrousette pans and just plain old steel pans, really.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of them's nicer, they last longer, they have different colors, cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just pans that you cook stuff in.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the food that you want, not the pans.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the transformation they want, not the coaching, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you could achieve everything without any help, you just do it, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: We have very few people in the world who teach us how to walk.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have very few people in the world to teach us how, by the way, there is a few times a day you're going to have this weird feeling and what you solve it with is called food.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have people who teach that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have courses every day that talk about how to manage hunger, how to, you get hungry, you eat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, eat too much, you get fat.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the point is, you don't have to teach that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only thing we teach is the things that get in our way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we can figure out how to transform, solve that bigger problem for somebody who has more money, they'll pay you more money to solve their problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have the same problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just have different, you know, constraints around it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So hope that helps.
[SPEAKER_06]: yeah there's admiring golden said it on a video yesterday like i that i saw so it's like there's rich people problems and then there's like you know
[SPEAKER_06]: the the the other problems of other people right and like rich people's problems like they have problems too and like they they pay you know and so you just got to find more of those right so and there are plenty of people and i would suggest you will it's like you've already had a lot of success stories and transformations of people transforming their identity and then stepping into that and then generating more revenue that's just a byproduct so highlighting them more
[SPEAKER_06]: I think is the course of action.
[SPEAKER_06]: And really painting that picture better for people of, hey, these are just a select few of some of my student success stories.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is this something that resonates with you?
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you want this type of transformation as well?
[SPEAKER_06]: Great, it's $3,000.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is my high ticket.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is where we really accelerate the learnings and the teachings.
[SPEAKER_06]: that would normally take somebody, the average person, a year, we really get very accelerated and do it in 12 weeks.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I work personally with them one-on-one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Justin, we only, if you have a hard stop.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, we got two minutes left.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shoot, okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, thank you, Andy, for that reminder.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so hopefully that helps out.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wanna go over to Brooklyn real quick.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, Fabio, tomorrow we'll get you.
[SPEAKER_06]: But Brooklyn, final word here.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got like a minute.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, final words.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have three things that I sell, t-shirts, action figures, and cameos.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cameo kept calling me up and saying, lower your price, even though I was doing very well on my cameos.
[SPEAKER_05]: I said, no, no, no, that don't make any sense to me, this and that, but I finally gave in.
[SPEAKER_05]: I lowered my price and my volume exceeded the raised price.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, and I, you know, through the volume of the lower price, it exceeded the high price of what I was making.
[SPEAKER_05]: So actually lowering my price made me more money.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I, I mean, I'm at a different, I got a brand.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a whole different ball game, but I just wanted to share that with you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, thank you, Brooklyn.
[SPEAKER_06]: Always a pleasure to hear from you, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Happy Tuesday.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, I think the distinction there is that when it comes to products and services are different, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the main distinction.
[SPEAKER_06]: And because you have such a strong brand, it made sense because you have the visibility, the credibility.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the profitability comes because you can increase the volume at a lower price for the product.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, that's that's why the revenue went up there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And and yeah, it's a it's a note for everyone that look, how can you productize your services?
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we try to do this all the time as consultants.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a consultant.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a business consultant.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I'm an entrepreneur, but ultimately I'm a business consultant.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And because I transform businesses, that's what I do.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's that's my superpower and I charge a lot of money for that but I don't really have like products I sell like Brooklyn you know I don't have action figures so but always be thinking about how can you productize your service into a package that is you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: affordable and reasonable for other people.
[SPEAKER_06]: So OK, I got to go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Final word over to you, Christelle, Andy, and then I'll sign us off.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Brooklyn.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you everyone for joining us.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll get you on the stage tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_06]: BK, James, Patricia, Fabio, my apologies.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll get you on the space tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_06]: 645 AM Pacific will be in a startup circle.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, Christelle, over to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I'll make it quick.
[SPEAKER_04]: Brooklyn, always great to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I love what you said about lowering the price because Justin, based on what VB said, I was gonna say maybe you should have like a $5, I don't know, buy me a coffee or something and use it like I used to say, you know, this is my subscription price.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have my subscribe button, but you know, if you wanna do this, this is what you can do.
[SPEAKER_04]: because you can have that, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So don't sleep on those $5 because those often turn into, you know, bigger things.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I think that was it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, it's been such a great space.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you everyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Much love, can't wait to see you all this evening.
[SPEAKER_04]: Join the Revenue Owning Community, come to the Mastermind tonight.
[SPEAKER_04]: You get more of this in a smaller setting and yeah, we wanna support you.
[SPEAKER_04]: So thanks again, Justin, much love everyone.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, much love.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Christelle.
[SPEAKER_06]: Always a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look forward to the mastermind tonight.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, I appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we'll be connecting up on the back channel.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, Andy, final word over to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: People have problems, and we solve the problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it doesn't matter what floor they work on, what their title is, or what kind of car they drive.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just people.
[SPEAKER_02]: We all have problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just have them at different roles and different perspectives.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be willing to help people where they are, not where you are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wherever they are, that's what they need help at.
[SPEAKER_02]: And appreciate all of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, bye.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, thanks, Andy.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a great point to end on.
[SPEAKER_06]: Meet people where they're at.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I guarantee you with this, if you meet people where they're at,
[SPEAKER_06]: you will find and identify other things you can upsell them on and cross sell them on.
[SPEAKER_06]: I almost guarantee it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I almost guarantee it.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, like I've been doing this a long time.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've worked with over a thousand companies.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you combine both my businesses and my employers, I've worked with a thousand companies.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I can tell you with ninety nine percent certainty that once you get in, you solve one problem.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a 99% chance that you're going to be able to help them solve other problems.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think we talked about it will space last week or whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like, you know, once you solve one problem, it's like, you know, it's you're opening up the door to solve their next big problem.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know who said it, but it wasn't me, but it was a great point because that's entirely true.
