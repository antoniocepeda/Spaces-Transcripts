[SPEAKER_07]: You know Ronin's membership has benefits.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay membership has benefits.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so But yeah, thanks guys for being here really appreciate it and Yeah, let's check in with Andy first Andy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_07]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, good morning.
[SPEAKER_09]: Happy Monday.
[SPEAKER_09]: I love Mondays because it's a day that ends and why and What are your systems approach to revenue generation?
[SPEAKER_09]: I
[SPEAKER_09]: I am a systems organized, structured person.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm the guy that you ask, how do we get this thing from here to over there?
[SPEAKER_09]: And the first question I ask is how many times, like once or like every day for the next 75 years, because there's a hundred ways to solve that problem.
[SPEAKER_09]: But without the right set of requirements and understanding, you can't do that.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you say, oh, well, we need to move it there and back every day for a long time, it's like, well, OK, is it going to change?
[SPEAKER_09]: I just ask questions until I really get a good understanding what the problem is.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I'll build a system that can be repeated.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's what
[SPEAKER_09]: I typically do.
[SPEAKER_09]: And again, I always start from the end.
[SPEAKER_09]: What's the result?
[SPEAKER_09]: What are we trying to do?
[SPEAKER_09]: And when I'm teaching the teams, I'll give you a quick update since I started down this road.
[SPEAKER_09]: When I teach different teams, and again, I've worked all over the world.
[SPEAKER_09]: So when I teach different teams about how to solve problems, the first thing we have to figure out is how do we get there?
[SPEAKER_09]: And almost everybody,
[SPEAKER_09]: only solves the problem with the tools that they know or the things that they imagine they can do.
[SPEAKER_09]: If I said, I have to move people from Sacramento to San Diego or from Sacramento to Florida.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_09]: Then the question is, how many people, how often, how fast do they have to get there?
[SPEAKER_09]: If they have to get there in a couple hours, it's only one choice.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, there's two choices.
[SPEAKER_09]: You send them in a rocket or you send them in a fast airplane.
[SPEAKER_09]: If it doesn't matter how long it takes, you could build a railroad.
[SPEAKER_09]: You could drive a car.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can pave a road.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can give them all motorcycles.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can put them on bicycles.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can force them to walk.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a hundred ways to get the answer, but
[SPEAKER_09]: Most people just go, oh, well, we could put them in a car.
[SPEAKER_09]: We could drive there.
[SPEAKER_09]: We can drive back.
[SPEAKER_09]: Whatever, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: They go with the tools that they have available and the ones that they've used in the past.
[SPEAKER_09]: The most important thing that you can do from a systems approach is imagine that you don't know anything and that your job is to figure out what the end of the story is and then write the story.
[SPEAKER_09]: Most people don't do that.
[SPEAKER_09]: They, you know, they,
[SPEAKER_09]: read the book, they go to the library, they turn over the last page and read the answer, and then they wonder if they want to read the book.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it's funny because when you write the book, you start writing chapter one.
[SPEAKER_09]: You need to write the answer and then figure out the best way to describe the questions and the teaching and the training of what you need to learn along the way to get to the end of the story.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, if you're going to be a systems approaching kind of perspective,
[SPEAKER_09]: Start with the end first.
[SPEAKER_09]: What does the diamond look like when you've finished polishing all the edges?
[SPEAKER_09]: Which is the kind of rock that is actually a diamond?
[SPEAKER_09]: Where are they located?
[SPEAKER_09]: Where do we dig for them?
[SPEAKER_09]: How do we find them in the earth?
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's go looking for diamonds first.
[SPEAKER_09]: Figure out what they are at the end, and then get there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, thanks for letting me go down the rabbit hole here on a Monday.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, no, I love it, Andy.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'll just add that your your past self is not going to get you to the future that you want.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, this is a big kick I've been on lately.
[SPEAKER_07]: And thanks to Will and thanks to a lot of you guys here.
[SPEAKER_07]: As you've known, probably in the last month, like my content has really shifted towards
[SPEAKER_07]: uh you know more recognizing the the self first and getting you to where you need to be right and you know as we know thanks to will look you're there's a direct correlation between your self-worth and your net worth right so with that in mind dandy's point you can't expect to become a millionaire with your past self right like you have to change like who you are as a person and it's all about who you're becoming
[SPEAKER_07]: It's who you're becoming in the process.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is absolutely critical.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you know anything about personal development, it's a multi-billion dollar industry, and there's a reason why.
[SPEAKER_07]: But in order for you to get to that next level, you got to have systems in place.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it starts with people, process, systems.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the formula.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the exact formula.
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't start with systems first.
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't start with process first.
[SPEAKER_07]: Notice you start with people first.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is absolutely critical.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't tell you how many times I go into companies and they have this shiny new object, which is their tech, and they're wondering why they can't push a button and make a million dollars.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, yeah, you need to have the right people in place first that run the systems, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: This is why people process systems.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the formula for success.
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely critical.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, let's jump over to Will and then we'll go to Christelle for kind of opening statements here.
[SPEAKER_07]: But this is going to be another good one here, guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Please like and repost the space.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're interested in MBA masterclasses, then this is the right space for you.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, the number one business show on X, according to other people, not just myself.
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel that way as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: But we're all about a mastermind.
[SPEAKER_07]: NBA masterclasses on the daily.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what we're all about here.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, OK, over to you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, thank you for being here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Justin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I can literally only stay for like three minutes because I've got a call in five.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I wanted to come up and say hi and start the week strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love what you just said there about, well, the focus on the self.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure that doesn't come to as surprise as anyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: But did you, I just want to check, did you catch the post I did yesterday inside the community about rewriting the old story?
[SPEAKER_07]: I did not, no, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got something good to look forward to, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I did a, basically a deep dive into why the old story filters your experience going forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll give you the TLDR version.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is literally going to be half a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you first encounter a situation, be it a business failure or anything else, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: A circumstance, your brain immediately constructs a
[SPEAKER_00]: a lens through which it's looking into the world from that perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the launch didn't go well, for example, the brain as a prediction machine is now going to look into the future through the lens of, oh, my launches don't work well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is why it's so vital to be aware of this that's going on under the surface, because that instinctive nervous system threat assessment is below your conscious mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not even thinking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea that who you are being determines what you get is, it's so vital to understand because you can never outperform your self-concept, your identity, your self-image.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea that what has happened in the past is not a win or a failure, it is a circumstance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can go back and re-pattern that to be in line with your chosen outcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so vital.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if anyone has read the book, Psycho-Cybernetics, and I know I go on about it all the time, Maxwell Maltz was saying in 1960 that a person can never outperform what they believe is possible for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you believe is possible for you, if you don't bring it
[SPEAKER_00]: if you don't bring your conscious mind to it, is determined by the events and circumstances that you experience and then create a meaning about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is why identity is the highest leverage point.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it's vital to start with the self.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really wish I could stay because I've got so much more I want to dig into, but I'll have to run guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a call, but I will be back afterwards if you're still going.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, thank you, Will.
[SPEAKER_07]: And keep an eye out for my posts, guys, and Will included, about, you know, the importance of all the greats in business and in sports, athletes, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: They all have a persona that they develop, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: So for Michael Jordan, it was Air Jordan.
[SPEAKER_07]: For Kobe Bryant, it was the Black Mamba, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, who is that persona that you have to develop and create as part of your identity to really step into to hit that next level, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is, I go deep into this because it's a big, big, I'm on a big kick, thanks to Will again on this.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's so true guys, it's so true.
[SPEAKER_07]: And now everything is making more sense.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm getting more clarity around,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, the importance of like the revenue Ronin, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, why did that, why would that, why did that persona come to be?
[SPEAKER_07]: And now everything's making sense.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I highly encourage you guys to check it out.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll drop a link to the video breakdown that I did.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, thanks again, Will, for being here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's, oh, Christelle, it looks like she's dropping down.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, she's coming back here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Timo, Ani, feel free to come up guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know where Andy went, but hopefully he'll come back here.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, I'm happy to bring some guys up, bring some of you guys up here to continue the conversation and co-host here.
[SPEAKER_07]: So let me get Christelle back up here.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, please check out our sponsor again, Play, which is, I linked it above in the purple pill, and use promo code REVENUERONAN at checkout to receive 5% off.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is just an AI ads powered platform that I use and my clients use, and we're getting great results here.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, okay, Christelle, over to you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Good morning, how's it going?
[SPEAKER_07]: We're right into business mode here, so hope your Monday's going well.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I love it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's amazing what we do for the people we love that we don't do for ourselves.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have been procrastinating taking my car into the shop because I don't like coming into these spaces.
[SPEAKER_08]: with a car.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want that.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what the man is for.
[SPEAKER_08]: But Marcus needed me to take his car in because he's running late to work.
[SPEAKER_08]: So here I am with his car and my car needed to be here weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_08]: So anyways, it's just amazing, you know what we do.
[SPEAKER_08]: But all is well things are really good.
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, it's been kind of a crazy morning.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, Ani.
[SPEAKER_08]: So good to see you Timo, Justin, I hope you all had a great weekend.
[SPEAKER_08]: Lucia is here.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been seeing Lucia with the buy me a coffee post, which I love that inspired me to do my recent post about my three favorite ways to monetize right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: Buy me a coffee.
[SPEAKER_08]: Beehive ads.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm obsessed and The Amazon Associates I got my first Amazon purchase.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I made my first 42 cents of revenue on Amazon.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm so excited I'm officially in the program y'all I've never made 42 cents from X.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, and I've been here for some years, but that's okay I know why it's because I don't do the things I'm supposed to do.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'll just go get monetized somewhere else and
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, come to these classes so that I learn how to generate revenue from X. I just spoke to you.
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, sounds good.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: um okay sorry that was the you know see this is the thing when people just see you talking to your phone they don't think you're working you know i'm like i'm at work right now i'm in a mastermind uh meeting people this is very important so anyways i'm gonna land there because i think they need to talk to me about the car but i'll be here and if you want to pass me co-host i can co-host
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, thanks Crystal.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for being here and dual duties there for you.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's awesome so.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, thanks for being here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Crystal as always and thanks everyone down below.
[SPEAKER_07]: Please like and repost this space.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be a great conversation here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's jump over to block face and just like a minute or two if you can.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, and then we'll go to Alex.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Justin, Crystal, it's an honor.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was attracted to this space because of the title, What's Your System's Approach to Revenue Generation?
[SPEAKER_05]: And that is what I want to do now.
[SPEAKER_05]: I am an individual rainmaker, and I want to transition from individual rainmaker to creator of a rainmaking system.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's why I'm here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for the conversation.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Blockface.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Love your profile.
[SPEAKER_07]: Digital mercenary.
[SPEAKER_07]: I love that you're in the right room for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: And entrepreneur.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you're definitely in the right space for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is a big challenge we have as you rightfully pointed out that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, we're really good at making others lots of revenue, but sometimes when it comes to ourself, thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes when it comes to ourself, we find challenges, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: We find challenges and I had to get a lot of coaching on this.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of coaching and I had to hire a positioning coach to help break me through these limitations I had.
[SPEAKER_07]: And all I can say is that.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a work in progress.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a work in process right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: But once you start identifying what the issue is, you can work through it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it starts with community.
[SPEAKER_07]: It starts with accountability and access to other people that are on that same journey.
[SPEAKER_07]: which is why the revenue running community was developed for this exact reason.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, great to have you here, Blockface.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just gave you a follow back.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so thanks for being here.
[SPEAKER_07]: And oh, Andy's back here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Great, great.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, all I can say is that the positioning coach really helped me identify how we stand out compared to other people, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: This is critical.
[SPEAKER_07]: So here's a pro tip.
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever you are as your persona, as your personal brand, your superpowers, as Andy calls them, whatever your superpowers are,
[SPEAKER_07]: for other people, you need to really see how you can make that a superpower for your own personal brand and for your clients that you serve.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there is a big distinction between a service-based business and a product-based business.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we'll break this down in another space.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the point is, when you're building a product and a brand,
[SPEAKER_07]: is a lot different than building your personal brand and a service-based business.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of differences there that we can break down another day.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the point is, is you got to identify, you know, which route you want to go, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: What is the business model that you want to focus on building?
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, go all in on that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, yeah, hopefully this is, you know, resonating with some of you guys, but, you know, establishing a clear business model
[SPEAKER_07]: whether it's a product or a service is absolutely critical.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, for me personally,
[SPEAKER_07]: because I've worked in a service-based businesses for many years, I haven't built as many products for myself.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have had some products, but the margins weren't there, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like you gotta be mindful of, hey, how can I make sure that I'm making enough margins for my business and for my products and services?
[SPEAKER_07]: So, okay, let's jump back over to Andy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Andy, are you here?
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we're gonna go to Alex.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you're good.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, sorry.
[SPEAKER_09]: I had to take a call there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, products are things that you give people.
[SPEAKER_09]: They take away services or something you do for them.
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, that's pretty simple.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, like if I give you advice, that's a service.
[SPEAKER_09]: If I write it down in a book and give you the book, that's now a product.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a simple distinction.
[SPEAKER_09]: There, uh, always try to move towards a product because once you create a thing, you can then sell that thing again forever without any more effort.
[SPEAKER_09]: Every time you provide a service where you're giving advice or something, you have to take some time and provide some kind of result.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so your, your goal should be to go from being a service to being a product.
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, if you look at every what,
[SPEAKER_09]: Name the top 10 or the top 500 companies, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: Go to the fortune 500, take the top 10.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're all product based companies, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: And then eventually there's a service in there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Occasionally some kind of big consulting company or whatever, but almost legal firms are in there.
[SPEAKER_09]: But the most of the big companies, Apple, Tesla,
[SPEAKER_09]: banks, Microsoft, they're all product-based companies.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you want to get bigger, get faster, create something once that you can sell multiple times.
[SPEAKER_09]: Makes sense, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to thank you for that word there, positioning coach.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I cannot think about a revenue system without first considering competitive kind of magic gardener
[SPEAKER_05]: quadrant type relative positioning.
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Andy, what you said about if we're going to go to a revenue system, then considering moving from service to product, those two things from service to product and positioning mentality is gold.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll stop.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, thank you, Blockface.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's great.
[SPEAKER_07]: Great to have you here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, these little gems we pick up along the way is absolutely critical.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so there's a quote that I live by in my, I live by this quote daily.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like you don't know it till you live it, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't know it till you live it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, um, when I did have a product on Shopify that was making $2,000 a month, I was only making $600 a month profit.
[SPEAKER_07]: It took me two years to get to that point.
[SPEAKER_07]: So,
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, every single person's journey is going to be different.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, but once you identify the positioning that you have in the marketplace, it's going to elevate your game.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, and this is why personal brands is the new sales funnel right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, this is, this is the reality, you know, Gary Vaynerchuk has been talking about it for a while, a long time.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Andy as well, and myself and many others on this platform, Ani, a lot of people, but personal brand is now the new sales funnel for the digital space.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like that, that's it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you can, and you got to identify how you're going to stand out from the crowd, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: There's thousands of marketing consultants, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: But how does Justin stand out?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, he's the revenue Ronan.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the brand.
[SPEAKER_07]: The positioning is, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: all around the brand, the revenue Ronin brand.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's like, what is your positioning?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's going to make you stand out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like you got to answer these questions because it's noisy and to get attention and keep attention.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's very challenging.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's very challenging.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't care what company you're with, or, you know, every single company has the same challenges that we do.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't think that they don't, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: But the advantage, the competitive advantage that we have as more solo slash small founders is that we have the ability to adapt and pivot and move quicker than them.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the advantage we have.
[SPEAKER_07]: And plus you couple that with AI, like there's no excuses now.
[SPEAKER_07]: The biggest thing that you can do to stand out is be consistent and stay consistent.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's really your your competitor.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's our competitive advantage right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, go ahead, Andy, and then we're going to go to Alex and then Christelle.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, first of all, shout out to Christelle for meeting up with Jodell.
[SPEAKER_09]: I saw that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Quite a cool post.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's so fantastic.
[SPEAKER_09]: And her mom.
[SPEAKER_09]: Daniel Priestly is also one of the, one of the big, you know, online marketers, and he is currently on a big kick, uh, the seven 11 four thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's all about personal brand right now is the best time in the world to create a personal brand.
[SPEAKER_09]: The actually the best time was like 15 years ago, but the second best time is today.
[SPEAKER_09]: Tomorrow is more difficult than today.
[SPEAKER_09]: So start today.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the, the lever that I've found,
[SPEAKER_09]: Not that I created, not that I heard from anybody else, but that I found that actually works.
[SPEAKER_09]: It goes like this.
[SPEAKER_09]: You have to define your voice, how you want to be heard.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what that means.
[SPEAKER_09]: And your audience, a narrow niche of people who are your most likely customers.
[SPEAKER_09]: your superpower, the two or three or things, not more than three, the two or three things that you have done that you do easily that everybody else wants help with.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: That, that, that's it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the math of it comes down to this.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you talk to a hundred people a day for a hundred days, that's 10,000 people.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you have a 3%, if you have a half to 1%,
[SPEAKER_09]: In other words, you talk to 100 people and one person a day engages.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay?
[SPEAKER_09]: Hold on, let me flip this.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, can you still hear me?
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, thumbs up.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you have one person a day that says okay, you talk to them for 100 days, you end up with 100 warm leads of that, you're probably going to close 20% of the people.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay?
[SPEAKER_09]: So, out of the 10,000, 20 customers.
[SPEAKER_09]: 20 customers at $500 a month of whatever your service or product that you're providing.
[SPEAKER_09]: is $10,000 a month, that's $120,000 a year.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you have a overall list of 10,000 warm contacts, you can turn that into at a 1% conversion per day.
[SPEAKER_09]: One person joins your email list.
[SPEAKER_09]: One person goes down your funnel.
[SPEAKER_09]: One person a day.
[SPEAKER_09]: And your end of your funnel is $500 a month, okay?
[SPEAKER_09]: 20 people
[SPEAKER_09]: 20 customers out of the 10,000 equals $10,000 a month in revenue.
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't need to pick 100,000 people.
[SPEAKER_09]: You probably can't get to them.
[SPEAKER_09]: Pick 10,000 and then go towards that so that you can talk to one real valid, warm, hot, qualified, validated lead a day and you can convert
[SPEAKER_09]: What's 20% of seven?
[SPEAKER_09]: That's like two or three a week.
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe one to two a week.
[SPEAKER_09]: Every week for 100 days, which is just three months plus a week, you end up with $100,000 a year annual revenue.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why it works.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you are, and that is if you are low average,
[SPEAKER_09]: Engagement rates are between 1% and 3%.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you go from 1% to 3% by the end of your 100 days or the second 100 days, you do the exact same list again.
[SPEAKER_09]: And this time, instead of selling them your $500 offer, you sell them the next offer.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you go from 1% to 3%.
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't need anybody else.
[SPEAKER_09]: You only need 10,000 qualified leads.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you can produce a six figure revenue stream forever.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you then add people and make it 20,000 qualified, validated, warm leads, you do that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Russell Brunson says, if you have an email list of 30,000 opt in people, 30,000 people on an email list,
[SPEAKER_09]: You'll never have to work again the rest of your life.
[SPEAKER_09]: You should be able to sell that list stuff and they'll buy it at 1-3% conversion rate.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just math.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not rocket science and anyone can do it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I talked to my son about this last night.
[SPEAKER_09]: I send
[SPEAKER_09]: between 20,000 to 30,000 emails a year for my consulting company business.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to give you the proof.
[SPEAKER_09]: I know what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_09]: I sell between $200,000 and $400,000 contracts a year, and I usually sell at two to three-year buckets.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's a $600,000 to $1 million contract that I sell as my consulting service I've been doing for 30 years.
[SPEAKER_09]: Go check out my website, look at my client list.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's on my bio.
[SPEAKER_09]: Go look at my blog.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's got millions of page views.
[SPEAKER_09]: I have proof.
[SPEAKER_09]: Boom, mic drop.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: I send 20 to 30.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Alex.
[SPEAKER_09]: I send 20 to 30,000 emails a year so that I can get 10 to 15 qualified leads.
[SPEAKER_09]: And of that, I usually close one to two contracts of whatever.
[SPEAKER_09]: Two four six hundred thousand dollar contracts.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's my business model for my big company So in the past I've said, you know, you know, you can shoot for this you can shoot for that you shoot higher I just I send you know hundred emails a day add it up It's not difficult to do if you just grind it out.
[SPEAKER_09]: It always works.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why I come to these.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why I say stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hopefully, you'll take what I say and go execute.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because if you can execute, it does work.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not just talking about stuff that I read in Alex Ramosi book.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm telling you stuff that I actually do daily.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, good stuff, Andy.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, let's go to Alex real quick and we'll go to Blockface and then Christelle.
[SPEAKER_07]: So just keep it like a minute or two if you can, Alex.
[SPEAKER_07]: I still got some alpha to drop on the topic here, you know, systems approach to revenue gen.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, but yeah, over to you, Alex.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey, thanks, Justin.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's always great to have a mic in your space and thanks for giving me a minute after listening to that ramble from Andy.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's always good to hear from him, obviously, with his advice and the revenue culture and how we can all benefit from it.
[SPEAKER_11]: But in the time that I was waiting to talk,
[SPEAKER_11]: I've actually been onto Amazon and bought a shitload of sulfuric acid to bathe myself in just to end it all.
[SPEAKER_11]: Because listen to this, there's a load of crock of shit.
[SPEAKER_11]: So good luck with the rest of the 30 seconds that I've got left.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hopefully I won't get terminated before then.
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah, it's always great.
[SPEAKER_11]: And marketing mastery, you know, get your USP, do something a bit different.
[SPEAKER_11]: Air Jordan was
[SPEAKER_11]: because he took off from the free-for-all line and dumped it and he made a brand for himself.
[SPEAKER_11]: So maybe we all need to do a bit of that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Alex.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for checking in here.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, uh, yeah, really, really appreciate your time and contribution.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, uh, and yeah, I think.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just this continuous learning journey that we're on and leveling up and you know, you don't know it till you live it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, but yeah, I like the Air Jordan reference.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's so true.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you look at any pro athlete or any professional business person, like they all have these personas that they tap into.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, it's like, who are you creating for your own personal brand, your persona?
[SPEAKER_07]: that you tap into for leverage and to hit that extra gear.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, thanks, Alex.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, let's jump over to Blockface and welcome to the stage.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just before you go to Blockface, if you want an instant rebuttal there,
[SPEAKER_11]: All you have to look is my PFP and apparently I look like somebody farting.
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, that's a tight end ready to get swatted by a 20 stone monster from Sweden.
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, but there you go.
[SPEAKER_11]: That there's my little profile picture.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's my USP.
[SPEAKER_07]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Good stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Blockface, you're up, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is my attempt to unify what I've heard from Justin and yourself and Andy and also what Crystal said earlier.
[SPEAKER_05]: So is what you're saying that personal branding is defining your voice, which really means defining how you want to be heard, which really means your competitive positioning amongst a niche for whom their problem set,
[SPEAKER_05]: which you find effortless, and an email list of opt-in equals freedom.
[SPEAKER_05]: Did I get that right?
[SPEAKER_08]: that was a really that was a really great summary yes email list yes if you take nothing else away email list email list email list grow grow grow also i'm just going to share really quickly what came to me this weekend because i think so much about personal branding we talk about it a lot and and i love it and i agree that it is
[SPEAKER_08]: It is what we all need to understand along with email lists and all these other things.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you know what came to me?
[SPEAKER_08]: The simplest thing, because I'm a teacher and I like to make it simple.
[SPEAKER_08]: The personal brand starts with who you are.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a brand.
[SPEAKER_08]: Think about a brand, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a stamp.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you can't get away from whoever you really are being stamped because at the end of the day, it's what other people's impression of you is, that stamp, it's that image, that brand of you.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you wanna have a great brand, you need to be a great you.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's why so much of it, when Will comes in here and he talks about the mindset and getting all that right, it's so important because it's gonna come out in your brand.
[SPEAKER_08]: Your brand is a brand.
[SPEAKER_08]: Think about it.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, it's a stamp.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so what does your stamp look like?
[SPEAKER_08]: Does it does it look like you?
[SPEAKER_08]: Does it sound like you?
[SPEAKER_08]: Does it align with your actual vision and who you want to connect with and all of that?
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, that's what you have to ask yourself.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's going to be a replication of you.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we can't get around that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's the
[SPEAKER_08]: People think that the brand a lot of times is something they create some version of themselves.
[SPEAKER_08]: But that's that's really not what it is, because you don't get to decide.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, the people at the end of the day are like, this is what we see.
[SPEAKER_08]: You think you're showing this, but this is the brand.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the image, you know, that we see.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and I'll just add on.
[SPEAKER_07]: So brand is how people feel.
[SPEAKER_07]: about you and your company.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the feeling.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what brand essentially is.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just to kind of just jump in.
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that OK?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, just make it quick.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think I think the thing is, is brand equals consistency, OK?
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's like with anything, whether it be motorsport, whether it be fashion.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, I meant a thumbs up.
[SPEAKER_11]: whether it be, you know, jewelry, whether it be a luxury goods, whether it be just, you know, corner shop type of brand like 7-Eleven or one thing or another, what people look for is consistency and the believability about what they're investing in.
[SPEAKER_11]: So whether you're investing money or whether you're investing in time, what they want is consistency.
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you're building a personal brand, you need to be consistent.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you need to be that person that shows up and not be fake and not be swayed one way or the other, and try and switch which way that you want to go.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you need to be that wholesome person that you set out to be.
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you're not, people just see through you and you'll fucking just go by the wayside, excuse the French, et al.
[SPEAKER_11]: People are looking for something where they can go, actually, I'm going to follow that person.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to invest my time in that person.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to listen to them what they're saying.
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is where sometimes spaces can be a bit of a word salad in so much as they go on for so long when really 400 words will do when you can just say two.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, thanks, Alex.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, great points.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so essentially a brand is what people feel and what they say about you when you're not in the room.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then marketing is really the tactics and the strategy behind that, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's what you do.
[SPEAKER_07]: So a brand is how people feel and the marketing and sales is what you do.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's essentially the, the, the high points.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, um, and, and look, the,
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, go, go ahead real quickly, Alex, and then we got to get to the other.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: But also you don't get to talk about how long people talk and then, you know, you keep interrupting.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, but the underpinnings, the underpinnings needs to be there, don't they?
[SPEAKER_11]: So you need to have that, you know, you need to have that balance and that like framework underneath before you can talk about the marketing stuff.
[SPEAKER_11]: Cause if, if, if that, if that foundation isn't there to begin with, then you might as well be just talking and stuff in there.
[SPEAKER_11]: You need to have.
[SPEAKER_11]: the 100% foundation of what it is that you're trying to set out.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then you can talk about all the rest of it afterwards.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then you can go on for as long as you want, because it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_11]: But if you're going to waffle on for hours and hours and hours, and you've not got anything behind you to back you up, you're wasting time.
[SPEAKER_11]: Because people just go, oh, well, you're full of shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that foundation, the system that we reference is critical.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that system is really,
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, driving back to your email list, ideally, and, you know, your personal brand or your company brand, that's really the system approach.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is why we're big on your email list, because that is part of the system.
[SPEAKER_07]: But you got to have a follow up system in place as well, which, you know, we'll get to that in a second.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I want to get to these hands.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Alex, for the contribution.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, let's go to Thrax and then we'll go to Hoops and then VB.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just keep it to like two minutes if you can, guys, because I still got some stuff I want to share some alpha for you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're kind of nearing the end.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll go till eight.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll go till eight today.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I want to make sure I get through this alpha because this is what
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, you know, I want to make sure I drop drop the the teachings here.
[SPEAKER_07]: So OK, Thrax like 2 minutes over to you and then hoops and then BB and then we'll continue on.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, thanks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, thanks Justin for this chance.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mine is just a question because I'm trying to grow my.
[SPEAKER_04]: Brand, uh, because
[SPEAKER_04]: I think people need protection, especially while trading on the internet.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you never know who gets scammed.
[SPEAKER_04]: You could be the next one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I've been doing a survey and updating it.
[SPEAKER_04]: on my profile but i'm not talking about maybe like the professional things like the ones everyone's doing on x because by the time you get to close that deal with your client you've already built the trust maybe have uh like video calls or stuff but there are things that are being traded that you know like one of you know
[SPEAKER_04]: But back to the topic, Andy, I wanted to ask, how do I get clients for an escrow service?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I don't think I need to have an email list.
[SPEAKER_04]: All I need to do is maybe approach people who have gotten scammed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you give me advice on that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_10]: account on what again Thrax?
[SPEAKER_10]: Where are the customers?
[SPEAKER_10]: Are they on a platform?
[SPEAKER_10]: They have an account somewhere?
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't need an email list because people don't even look at them.
[SPEAKER_11]: The email...
[SPEAKER_10]: Hold on Alex.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thrax, what was the question you were asking?
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, because like
[SPEAKER_04]: My brand, I'm positioning myself as trust between traders on the internet, especially the crypto bros.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like protecting them from getting scammed because I've seen like people go to- Okay, okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[SPEAKER_09]: Only one question at a time.
[SPEAKER_09]: So the first question is,
[SPEAKER_09]: Where do you find the people my question was where where are they now?
[SPEAKER_09]: How do you how do you get a hold of them?
[SPEAKER_09]: And you said well that and then you gave me a definition of the customers How do you get a hold of the customer?
[SPEAKER_09]: Where are the customers?
[SPEAKER_09]: Are they on an exchange?
[SPEAKER_09]: Are they on x are they on linkedin?
[SPEAKER_09]: Are they on?
[SPEAKER_09]: Telegram what where where are they?
[SPEAKER_04]: They're on
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they are on ads, on forums.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you need to find people, reach out to them and either create a connection or give them an offer.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then when they give an offer, where do they go?
[SPEAKER_09]: If you want to help them, they have to go somewhere.
[SPEAKER_09]: Typically you send them to a landing page and the landing page needs to be able to communicate some result to them.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's usually an email list.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can do it via DMs.
[SPEAKER_09]: In other words, you DM someone, they DM you back, you send them something in a DM.
[SPEAKER_09]: But if you send them something, you want it to be more permanent, send it in an email.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why email lists work.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why if you go to kit.com or Beehive or any of the other ones, you can, it will give you landing pages and then capture their email in exchange for a landing page or whatever the thing you're giving them.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was called a lead magnet.
[SPEAKER_09]: You give them something in exchange for their communication.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then you use that communication to talk to them about the next things.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why email lists work.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why newsletters, email lists, newsletters, they all are the same thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me add real quick, I'm gonna make it so quick, because Justin, I know you have alpha, but as far as personal brand goes, I would not trust someone with your PFP and name just off the bat.
[SPEAKER_08]: So part of personal brand, if you're trying to be in the business of building trust with people who have been scammed, I highly recommend getting another account that has your face and name on it.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is what I mean, we gotta start with the basics.
[SPEAKER_08]: Who are you?
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, why am I gonna come to you when you look like the person I'm scared of being scammed by, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm not saying you are, but that's the image, like the image matters.
[SPEAKER_08]: It really does matter.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, okay, that's my two cents, thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's a great point Christelle brings up.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, I mean, essentially,
[SPEAKER_07]: Look, we would all want the opportunity to just post content, and then our DMS get flooded in our email list get flooded like that that would be great.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the reality is, that's not how it works.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right, that's not how it works.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did we lose Tristan?
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I thought it was just me.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, me too.
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought it was me.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sounds like we were about to have another moment of silence.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pleasant Nordic pause.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Why don't we move on with the hands?
[SPEAKER_08]: I think Hoops is next.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say quickly, I would say quickly to Trax that there are in Beehive platform, there are huge crypto newsletters and they're all about spreading whatever
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever the blockchain they're doing and all their offers are there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have them in evergreen content on a page where all the articles land and they stay there for Google and SEO.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you guys want to operate in Telegram and Discord and wherever but people get scammed and the reality is
[SPEAKER_02]: that when you post content on X, I have 8.2k followers.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I post a post here, like even the hardcore people who actually come and comment on my content, probably like less than 10% of them will ever see that post.
[SPEAKER_02]: So email is always there, even though Alex said nobody opens the emails, but
[SPEAKER_02]: There's 380 billion emails sent every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you do the math, I think that's still the place to sell whatever you have and to make a point on whatever you have.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's my little spiel for newsletters and emails.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, don't come in here talking bad about the emails and newsletters.
[SPEAKER_08]: We will get you.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's keep going.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the DMZ are bullshit like DMZ are bullshit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I nobody answers DMZ.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like the worst.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I have pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you mean?
[SPEAKER_08]: DMZ is great.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do as I say, not as I do, not as I do.
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't done them in a long time, but when I've had to, I've done them and they've been great.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, let's get to the hands.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hoops, I think you're next.
[SPEAKER_08]: Grab that mic or Justin.
[SPEAKER_08]: Justin's back on the mic.
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you back, Justin?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, my goodness.
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, me neither.
[SPEAKER_08]: But you went out a while ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah, let's just go over to Hoops and then VB for minutes and then then I'll drop the alpha and then we can continue the conversation.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, thanks.
[SPEAKER_07]: Go for it, Hoops.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, morning, everybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hope everybody's doing well.
[SPEAKER_06]: Great room, as always.
[SPEAKER_06]: Always appreciative to come in here and share and learn.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's great to hear what everybody's talking about.
[SPEAKER_06]: This email situation, I'm glad.
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember a couple of years ago, we were in the same room, Crystal.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know who was it that was really, really talking up that email stuff, the newsletter.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you jumped on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: We were in the room together.
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember this was like two years ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, I didn't make
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyway, I'm making my move now and that's thanks to you and what this community has been doing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And thanks to Grok too, because Grok has done a great job of helping me to put together my personal branding, at least define my personal branding.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because once I was applying for some of these voiceover and creative director positions, you know, really for experience of it all, I learned that,
[SPEAKER_06]: the AI does a great job of putting my, my profile together and my personal branding and my, my business branding, um, as well, just from, just from, um, uh, dropping the, um, asking it, you know, to write my profile according to the, the resume job description.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it was easy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hold on one second.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it was easy to, um, it was easy to, to get that defined for me.
[SPEAKER_06]: So now I understand my personal brand.
[SPEAKER_06]: much better what I offer, you know, what I'm offering, uh, you know, to clients, so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm thankful for that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, um, it's, um, I've also narrowed down my, my, my branding now too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, so my newsletter is, yeah, it's branded and I can, all the things that I do now I can put onto that newsletter and thanks, thanks to Grok for really defining, you know, what,
[SPEAKER_06]: what my personal brand look like or what it offers and the business brand as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, it did a great job putting that together for me.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, I'm off the races.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just having some fun with some pretty cool things right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, man, appreciate you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, thanks for tapping in.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, just to answer the question, like, why would you want a personal brand in a company brand?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, let me answer that for everyone.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can't really sell your personal brand.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can sell your company and your company brand there.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a value attached to a business brand, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a value to Apple, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a value to, uh, you know, Dell or Microsoft, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a brand, there's brand equity.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's called brand equity.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's brand equity associated with company brands, just like your personal brand.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, the reason why you would want a business brand and a company brand is because you'll have the option.
[SPEAKER_07]: Notice I said, the keyword is option to sell that business brand in the future if you want.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can't sell your personal brand.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can license your personal brand.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I can license Justin to other companies, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: I can license it, but I can't sell my personal brand.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, but I can sell the revenue Ronan, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: I can sell the brand.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because why that's a business asset, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: So, so just like real estate, like these are digital assets, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: These are digital.
[SPEAKER_07]: Assets.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is the level of mindset you need to have when you're playing this game is what is my equity that I'm building, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: We're, we're investing sweat equity, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: We're investing a lot of sweat equity to build our personal brands, to build our company brands for the future in the hopes of having the option.
[SPEAKER_07]: to sell our company brand or license our personal brands.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the game.
[SPEAKER_07]: So hopefully this is resonating with people and it's not going to happen overnight.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you think you're going to come onto this platform and make millions of dollars, like, no, you're in like a five-year journey.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're not willing to play the long game, then you're not in the game.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're not willing to play the long game, then you're not in the game.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's that simple.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is just real talk here.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is real talk.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, all right, let's go to VB, and then I want to drop some alpha, and then we'll get to the other speakers.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, okay, VB, over to you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just keep it to two minutes if you can, please.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely, Justin.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm waiting for your alpha as well, so I'll try to keep it as short as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to talk about Trax's question real quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was talking about crypto and Bitcoin and the kind of people don't get scammed and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bro, I think you can just write about your knowledge here on X, talk about the knowledge that you have, build a following, get a lot of impressions, show people that you are an authority in your subject, show people that you know what it is and how much people get scammed here.
[SPEAKER_01]: and uh and yeah just be an authority in your subject that's number one number two is i understand your profile picture i think that's your brand kind of uh that's what your brand looks like i guess that's what your website looks like perhaps um but i agree with christelle's point about you keeping your profile picture a different
[SPEAKER_01]: your face or at least something else and not your kind of website brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like Timo said, a lot of people talking about Bitcoin.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can talk about it on your newsletter as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you said it yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: People here, your customers are on X. I mean, if they're on X, they can subscribe to your newsletter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in newsletter, you show authority and you can convert them from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now,
[SPEAKER_01]: to personal branding once again guys I mean for personal branding it's anybody who who's trying hard to build a brand online or who's trying hard will eventually I would say burn out because personal branding is not hard at all you are just sharing your everyday life so
[SPEAKER_01]: When you live an interesting life, you just simply talk about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you live an interesting life?
[SPEAKER_01]: You talk about, let's say you go to work, talk about your work, that becomes your content.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say you went to the park with your kids, talk about how it felt, talk about that experience, that becomes your content.
[SPEAKER_01]: People want to read about your life, they relate to it because you talk about your life, number one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, he goes to the park with the kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he still earns a million dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me see how.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they want to find out how because you live the same life, but you still get a million dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: So they'll follow you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Being authentic in this age is absolutely vital.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are trying hard to create content, you will eventually burn out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're living an interesting life, you just have to talk about your interesting life online and people will follow you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how, in my opinion, you build and build an effortless personal brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, when it comes to revenue systems approach to revenue generation, I mean, I have had ups and downs in this and I've had my theories on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had my learnings on this and through failures as well as through my learnings, what I can tell right now is yes, I'm building a product, of course, but
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to have sales first and I'm coming back to sales once again.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to have clients first, you need to have testimonials first, you need to have proof of sales, proof that your product works because when I have a product, who's going to buy it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why would they buy it if there's no proof?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why would they buy it if there's no testimonial that I can put on my page?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I can have paid ads for a month, two months, three months.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after three months, what?
[SPEAKER_01]: They would buy, but of course, if I don't have a brand, then they wouldn't know me after my paid ads just get expired.
[SPEAKER_01]: They wouldn't know me and I'm back to zero sales once again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So building a personal brand alongside is absolutely vital.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sales first, DMs is absolutely crucial.
[SPEAKER_01]: DMs would work absolutely fine, guys, if you display authority in your subject.
[SPEAKER_01]: People should display authority in their subject.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to DM people out of the blue.
[SPEAKER_01]: You talk about the stuff that you're actually good at, prove your authority in it, people will engage to your post, will ask you questions on your post, DM them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely, that's absolutely fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a cold DM anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a warm, semi-warm DM, anything, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my take on it, and you can get clients from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you send five DMs a day, 30 days, that's 150 DMs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three months, that's 450 DMs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you telling me you cannot convert 10% of that?
[SPEAKER_01]: 10% of that is 45.
[SPEAKER_01]: 5% of that is 23.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you telling me you cannot convert 5% of 450 people that you DM?
[SPEAKER_01]: 22 something clients for your $500 offer equals to how much?
[SPEAKER_01]: $11,000?
[SPEAKER_01]: Boom, there you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a couple of my points.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty much it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I'm waiting for your alpha, Justin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over to you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, thank you, VB, for that alpha.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I mean, it all starts with sales, guys, and business development.
[SPEAKER_07]: And VB's right.
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to serve and sell first and demonstrate your value first, and then people will pay attention and then they will convert and buy.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if people are asking questions, that's a clear indicator that there's interest there, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: There's interest.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's job one is to generate interest, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Attention, interest, desire, action, the old ADA formula, attention, interest, desire, action.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, whether or not they have budget or not, that's completely different topic.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the point is, at least you're generating attention and interest to what the topic is that you are an expert in, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's just a natural progression that once people are interested, they'll be asking questions and that that's clear indicator that, wow, I'm interested in, you know, this particular person, this topic, you know, maybe even the service that they offer.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then it's just naturally you want to convert them.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, again, if they have the budget or not, it doesn't really matter.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the point is that you're achieving that interest level and you're getting traction, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: You're getting traction.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's big.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then ideally you want to separate those people that have the budget and those people that don't have the budget.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is why you need three different price points at all times.
[SPEAKER_07]: And let's just be honest.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of the people that are on X may not have the budget for your products and services, which is why you need to be fishing in a different pond.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's not too many people on X that can afford my 90 day program at $30,000.
[SPEAKER_07]: There just isn't, which is why I'm on LinkedIn and I'm on other networks and, and, and offline.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's, that's, that's where I'm fishing.
[SPEAKER_07]: The, the, the people that are on X may not have your budget.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you have to.
[SPEAKER_07]: have an offer accordingly.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is really critical.
[SPEAKER_07]: So before I start to drop this alpha here, please like and repost the space.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've only had three people repost the space, which is like terrible.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you guys can like and repost the space, would really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, this space is sponsored by Play.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's an AI as powered platform.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can check out the link in the pinned post here.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's basically an AI ads powered platform.
[SPEAKER_07]: So once you have a validated offer, product or service that converts, then you can do paid ads.
[SPEAKER_07]: But you don't want to do that until you have a proven offer, product or service that has converted, then you can run sales, or then you can run ads.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the main takeaway.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, please like and repost the space, guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so let me spend a couple minutes here dropping some alpha on this specific topic here.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's your system's approach to revenue generation?
[SPEAKER_07]: So again, this is the formula.
[SPEAKER_07]: People, process, and systems.
[SPEAKER_07]: People, process, and systems, in that order.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do not mess up the order, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: If you have an email platform, for example, Beehive,
[SPEAKER_07]: and you're not an expert in beehive, well then find someone who's an expert in beehive and have them help you, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Or learn it yourself.
[SPEAKER_07]: You gotta ask yourself that question.
[SPEAKER_07]: Am I gonna spend the time, energy, money, resources, learning curve to learn beehive myself, or am I gonna delegate that to my team?
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's the next formula.
[SPEAKER_07]: Learn it, do it, delegate it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Learn it, do it, delegate it.
[SPEAKER_07]: If I'm not gonna be the person to learn it, right, I'm gonna delegate it, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why I have Timo helping me, because I'm not gonna learn Beehive and become an expert on Beehive, why?
[SPEAKER_07]: I need to stay in my zone of genius, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I figure it out?
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: But where is my time most valuable?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's on business development, closing deals, running ads, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's where I need to stay.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, and then the last thing I'll say is,
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is the exact formula that I'm using right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you've been paying any attention to my content for October, which we're in November now, but I've really 10, 20x my content in October.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what did I do?
[SPEAKER_07]: I systemized it, I magnetize, I monetize, and I optimize, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: So systemize, always drawing people back to,
[SPEAKER_07]: the email list, getting them to subscribe to the email, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: By offering a free gift, which I'm finalizing right now, but giving them and answering the question, what's in it for them, they're gonna get a bonus chapter or whatever that lead magnet is, really define it, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: So you wanna have a systemized approach for your content generation, which for me, it's record Zoom videos and then use Clod and get
[SPEAKER_07]: 14 different pieces of content, and then get it scheduled and get it posted.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the systemized approach.
[SPEAKER_07]: Magnetize, so you wanna make sure your content is magnetizing people to your personal brand, to your company brand, and to your products and services.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you wanna monetize it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So once they're on your email list, or once they're replying to your messages on LinkedIn or X,
[SPEAKER_07]: then you're following up with them in the DMs, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: VB hit the nail on the head there.
[SPEAKER_07]: You got to follow up, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: You got to follow up and you got to follow through, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Follow up and follow through.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you optimize what's working.
[SPEAKER_07]: So now that you have this system, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Your content system, you're magnetizing people, you're monetizing people by getting them onto your email list and or in the DMs.
[SPEAKER_07]: and they're scheduling calls with you, which is this is exactly what happened with me in October.
[SPEAKER_07]: So now you know it works and then you can optimize.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what type of content is getting the most impressions and the most engagement?
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you want to iterate off of that and do more of that type of content.
[SPEAKER_07]: Why?
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it's already shown social proof and validation that it works.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so you want to do more of what works and less of what doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is essentially marketing.
[SPEAKER_07]: At the end of the day, all marketing is, is doing more of what's working and less of what's not working.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so now that you have all this content being generated, it's magnetizing people, you're monetizing it, ideally.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's time to optimize, analyze all the previous month's posts, look at what's generating the most interest, the most engagement, and the most lead generation, and do more of that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's essentially it.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the whole entire system.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what's your system's approach to revenue generation?
[SPEAKER_07]: This is it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just broke it down for you.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm glad this is recorded.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hopefully this is helpful.
[SPEAKER_07]: But this is essentially it.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is all I'm doing now.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've used October as the testing ground.
[SPEAKER_07]: My content generation has gone up like 20x.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, some of the platforms aren't
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, working as well and I'm not getting as much engagement, but my top two, my top two platforms right now are LinkedIn and X, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I'm really leaning in towards heavy.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the other stuff I'm doing on YouTube and, uh, you know, other platforms, it's really just more of a visibility play.
Uh,
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is the formula again.
[SPEAKER_07]: Visibility plus credibility equals profitability.
[SPEAKER_07]: Visibility plus credibility equals profitability.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so hopefully this was helpful.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's go over to Timo and then we'll go to the hands.
[SPEAKER_07]: We got eight minutes left guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: We got a hard stop at eight.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll go to Timo and then we'll go to Kachi and VB and then we'll sign off.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, thanks.
[SPEAKER_07]: Timo, over to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, hey, one quick note for Thrax and all the crypto folks and pretty much everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a rare moment in time actually going on where you do have to understand that there's a shift of generational wealth from the silent generation and boomers to the X generation.
[SPEAKER_02]: AKA the Forgotten Ones and the Early Millennials.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you're aiming for bigger bucks, the little time that I ever did try what crypto is all about, except buying some Bitcoin and just holding it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The the only thing that I realized it was a bunch of young people trading like three digits in the decimal of some weird coins and maybe making couple dollars out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course there are bigger players out there and it's not but just the generalization here on X when you go into the crypto spaces I sometimes go and lurk there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a lot of just like shilling on some weird coin that is worth air.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the concentration on where to aim at when you are targeting your products and services, you do have to hit us 40 and ups, closing to 50s.
[SPEAKER_02]: So our parents just keep on living, but the money will shift down below
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is something you kind of have to figure out and that's what is happening right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, thanks.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for that Timo.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, the shifting of wealth.
[SPEAKER_07]: And a lot of these baby boomers that are retiring, they have like these boring businesses that, you know, they're not sexy, they don't have AI, but they do generate cashflow.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I also encourage people to keep an eye on some of those, but you do need an operator to operate those businesses, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, thanks for that, Timo.
[SPEAKER_07]: Always great to see you, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hope you had a great weekend.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, I'll be hitting you up on the back channel for some stuff on,
[SPEAKER_07]: some some stuff i'm working on cooking up here you know you know me i'm always cooking so all right man let's go to vb and then we'll start wrapping up here okay vb i think kachi's been waiting for a while sorry kachi sorry about that yeah kachi real quick uh minute over to you yeah good day um everyone and then i think he's a very nice one in presence of
[SPEAKER_03]: Andy, Justin, and then I think I've seen Amir.
[SPEAKER_03]: So my question is around sales and then I'm a startup founder and then I'm building a startup and it's been four weeks, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I launched an MVP, so I will just quickly say what I'm building and I would like to get an
[SPEAKER_03]: phase of looking for the early users and then I have no idea about sales or anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: So my startup is basically just, so my profile is an AI platform that helps people understand their data.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just for businesses that use Excel sheets, so it helps them kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: Visualize the data and help them give them permission to ask questions to their data through the platform.
[SPEAKER_03]: So right now I got few advice from few startup founders that I shouldn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: viewed the entire thing first, that I should first of all try to see if this is what users want, and then that's the page I want.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm also trying to see if reaching out to people through their email and through their DMs is the right way to go, and actually how to find people that really needs the product.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to get advice from Andy or Justin on where did I get these guys from.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know according to stats that almost
[SPEAKER_03]: 70% of businesses still use Excel sheets, and most of them would like to analyze and visualize the data.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm just looking at where can I find these guys?
[SPEAKER_03]: Where can I find the early users?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so real quickly here, because we're kind of going till the end of the show here, but I'll just say.
[SPEAKER_07]: Ideally, I would start hosting spaces and you know, really draw crowds in that way and you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: Share with people what you're building and say that you hey you're looking for beta users for your app and I would update your profile too because what you said about.
[SPEAKER_07]: the challenge people have with data doesn't reflect that at all.
[SPEAKER_07]: It just says, I build websites.
[SPEAKER_07]: In all honesty, that's not the most compelling positioning.
[SPEAKER_07]: You really have to change your profile first and foremost to attract people and share like, hey, this is what I'm doing, this is what I'm working on, because you got to stand out from the noise.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's very noisy, it's very crowded.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so how you're going to differentiate yourself is with your bio.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's number one.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then number two, I would host spaces and just say, Hey, you know, I'm looking for, you know, beta users.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's what I'm launching and just collect feedback and do a prelaunch, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: A prelaunch is very effective because a, you can have just a basic landing page and get people to opt in that way.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you can start communicating with them via email on, Hey, you know, what challenges are you having with your data?
[SPEAKER_07]: I know you're having challenges with data.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's the stat that backs it up, that statement.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, you know, how your solution, uh, how your product or service is the solution that they're looking for.
[SPEAKER_07]: Essentially, that's it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And do a prelaunch, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Because you don't want to build a whole entire product.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then it's like, Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have any users.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have any paid users.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have any free users, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Free users are great.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, at least it's validated that you have users.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, but then ultimately you want to make sure you have a clear revenue generating path, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: You need to be ironclad and have that figured out.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, and it's got to look something like a prelaunch capture emails and then like an introductory offer, which is very affordable.
[SPEAKER_07]: and
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll say to Kochi, your offer, book a demo, always annoyed with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Takes the time, it needs scheduling, whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you're talking about enterprise data.
[SPEAKER_02]: Understand what that means.
[SPEAKER_02]: It means a whole shit ton of security and who is willing to feed their data into your app.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need some reputation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hit me up on the back channels.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't allow DMs with non-premiums, but I follow you, so after you follow me, you can hit me up with DMs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have some ideas, and I can do some testing around if I have some time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks, Timo.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, final word over to you, Christelle and Andy, and then we're going to sign off here.
[SPEAKER_07]: But thanks, guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Timo.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, thank you, it's been another great space and I hope you'll have a wonderful rest of the day.
[SPEAKER_08]: See you tomorrow, build that email list, build that email list, send those newsletters, get paid for it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got my first report from day one, $12, I'm so excited.
[SPEAKER_08]: I will definitely write newsletters for money, okay?
[SPEAKER_08]: I will definitely do it, so I hope you all do too.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a great source of income, especially if you're already sending newsletters.
[SPEAKER_08]: So wonderful.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Andy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Over to you.
[SPEAKER_09]: A systems approach is only work if the systems work, but, or, and if the systems work and you work them, they'll work for you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Find somebody who's done things.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why I like Alex Hermosi and Gary V. They've actually done all the things they've said.
[SPEAKER_09]: I like Russell Brunson and Daniel Priestley because they've done the things they've said, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: Follow people who are doing the thing you want done and then follow their system.
[SPEAKER_09]: Become the best student of their system.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, Jim Chong, the lazy Canadian investor who's not here today, but
[SPEAKER_09]: He said, I followed Jeff Walker's launch formula.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all I did.
[SPEAKER_09]: He said, I invested all my money.
[SPEAKER_09]: I followed what Warren Buffett and some of his other investor mentors, he said, I read their book.
[SPEAKER_09]: I did exactly what they said.
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't come up with anything new.
[SPEAKER_09]: I just followed their advice.
[SPEAKER_09]: Do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Find somebody who does what you say, who has what you want, who's doing the things that you want to do.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it doesn't it's not probably not me.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's probably somebody else but the point is follow somebody and then just do what they say and And then just become the best student of the person who has what you want.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks Yeah, thanks Andy and hat tip to Andy because you know, he's been talking about you know the system the content system for a while and I've pretty much
[SPEAKER_09]: You know finalized finally you decided to take the advice and you started to build your own and guess what?
[SPEAKER_09]: Works, doesn't it?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, and and I credit Andy because look sometimes we need other people to put the fire under our butt and that's exactly what I did for October finally and just formalized it
[SPEAKER_07]: And with Buffer, you can see here the data, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: So I shared 26 posts last week.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got 102 reactions.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's 30% or that's plus 30 this week.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then got the comments.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, you know, the point is, is it's working.
[SPEAKER_07]: The system's working.
[SPEAKER_07]: So to Andy's point, the system only works if you work it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, uh, does it take time, energy, resources, money, investment?
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: It takes all those things.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you got to ask yourself the question, do I want to do it myself or do I want to have other people do it for me?
[SPEAKER_07]: And maybe it's a mix of both, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like it's only me and my VA.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I have a VA, a virtual assistant.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, um,
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't need a huge team to pull off some of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: With AI now, you can systemize a lot of it and semi-automate.
[SPEAKER_07]: The last thing I'll share, automation doesn't always mean automatic.
[SPEAKER_07]: Ideally, yes, but you have to do things manually first, and then you can figure out what you can automate.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thinking that you have just this push button to success, it's a misnomer.
[SPEAKER_07]: The reality is you have to go through a lot of different iterations, a lot of testing, a lot of QC, a lot of fill in the blank to get to the point where, okay, great, I'm at a point where I can just plug in my content and boom, it goes, it works, and I get some inbounds, I get some appointments and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you're continuously enhancing and refining and improving on the system.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: It always you have to always improve.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so marketing is all testing at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so continuous testing and improvement is what it's all about.
