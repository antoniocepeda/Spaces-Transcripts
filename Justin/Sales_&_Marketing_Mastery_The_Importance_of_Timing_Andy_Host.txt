[SPEAKER_01]: All right, we're going to get started.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to start talking because I'm guest hosting for Justin today, uh, and for the next couple of days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, we're going to talk about the importance of timing and, uh, thanks Timo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for joining.
[SPEAKER_01]: Appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll have a little conversation while we get some other folks up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm hitting some buttons in the background while we're doing that and updating software and running other stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey Timo, how you doing today?
[SPEAKER_01]: How's it going up there in the lovely Finland?
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, hey, all is good.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm actually going to be jumping into my youngest house.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a because we are a bilateral country.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a like the Swedish Appreciation Day and she's in a
[SPEAKER_06]: She's in a class where they just, all the teaching and whatnot is done in Swedish.
[SPEAKER_06]: So out of all of us, she is like fluent in Swedish.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, it's, so they have the Sweden Appreciation Day today.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'll be hopping into that in like 15 minutes, but I'll call hosts until then.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's uh, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: My grandmother, uh immigrated from sweden.
[SPEAKER_01]: So i'm a quarter swedish My grandfather came from norway on my father's side so my father is swedish half swedish and half norwegian, but really Uh, I think I told you this before but my great-grandfather Uh, and my all my family is from finland
[SPEAKER_01]: But because of the, in World War I, there was all of this conscription into the Tsar's army.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so my grandfather left and went to Norway to escape that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and that's, that's, that's how we became quote unquote Norwegian.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, actually the World War I was a civil war in here.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was Reds who were pro-Russian Empire.
[SPEAKER_06]: the white nationalists which then they went to Germany to train into a Jäger battalion and they came across the sea from Sweden to the west coast of Finland and they pretty much steamrolled over the socialists and sent them packing across the border.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, now the funny part in my family history, we only talk about the Norwegians and not anybody older than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So kind of a funny, interesting story there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, but congratulations and have fun at your daughter's Swedish Appreciation Day.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, thanks.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, you do have a village.
[SPEAKER_06]: No way.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes name.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hey, you should go and chief around there well, actually It's family village, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the the main farm that was their lap two years ago was up for sale and Everyone in the family was asked you want to buy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, I don't have enough money.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would But yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep, it's there's a little village.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a crossroads.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's like six houses It's it's not a very big place.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, lots of fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, thanks for everybody for joining Justin's out today Actually, he's out today tomorrow Monday and Tuesday.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I will be guest hosting this space For that time and we would love to talk to you guys about that we're going to talk about today is the importance of timing and not
[SPEAKER_01]: your timing, not the timing of your offer, not the timing of the sale, not the timing of your delivery, but the timing of your customers.
[SPEAKER_01]: When are they ready?
[SPEAKER_01]: The funny thing is we all have great offers.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, I know everybody here and who's on so far, you guys all have great offers and they're all fantastic, but they're all important for somebody at the time of their life when they need it.
[SPEAKER_01]: not necessarily when we need to sell them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, always have to remember that the importance of timing is the client, the customer, their willingness.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have gone to many, many seminars that I listened to, absorbed the information, academically listened, can write down what they say, can repeat what they say, but it didn't actually make a difference in my life until many, many years later.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's probably true for a lot of people that when we Absorb information or we want to buy something or we have a need we need that we need we hate we We need our need to be filled then not before and definitely not after so Love to hear some thoughts about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thanks for joining and
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you uh, did you guys have bonfires last night?
[SPEAKER_01]: I it is bonfire night on the 5th of november Did do you guys do that in wales?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was so many fireworks Okay, like I live like half a mile from a rugby club and they were doing a display and a carnival and that kind of stuff so I was over here with my headphones on doing some writing and I take the headphones off and it looks like um
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like there's a war going on outside because of all the explosions It was great, you know, it was All the kids are having fun and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, it was it was fun, but a little distracting for me so I had my headphones on got my head down and Revised chapter 6 of my book from beginning to end.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was a productive evening Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took your advice when that was a couple weeks ago you guys said oh you should I
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm working on I've still reached out to try to find the the actual Family owners publishers of one of my favorite books, which is called Malloy's popularity game about becoming likable and In asking them or trying to figure out how I can do the audio recording of it now I can cheat and simply
[SPEAKER_01]: go to Eleven Labs, put in the transcript, which by the way was really difficult to get to.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you want to know how I got the transcript?
[SPEAKER_01]: I took a picture of every page of the book, uploaded the picture into an LLM and said, please transcribe this for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it turned it into text.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I took the text and put it into a document.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have my own version of it, which then of course I can turn on
[SPEAKER_01]: Any of the audio readers of text and it and it reads to you, but it's not quite the same, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Doesn't have the same inflection doesn't have the same it just the monotone bubba and then it it will mess up like the word live It'll say and now live andy from like really Because it's spelled the same and without context It needs audio direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the same way we get on scripts Yeah, same thing
[SPEAKER_01]: I've read Like I have a unique voice it's it's not as awesome as yours It's just different but I've been asked to do the you know, and now You know kind of kind of intros I've done a lot of those high school games where you do 27 number 27, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done that kind of stuff and
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been asked to do some other kind of intro recordings.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a bunch of recordings where I do all the voiceover stuff from a number of years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm familiar with it, but at one point I thought, maybe I should do, no, please.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not, you know, there's just so many, so many things to do and so many different craziness.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I'm simply stretching time because there's no hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: The importance of timing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: When you want something is when you want it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why there are drive-thrus in America.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if there's drive-thrus everywhere in the world, but you want food, you want food now, go through a drive-thru and you can get it now.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want food, in some places you have to stand in line and wait.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an event.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're just hungry, you don't want the big production.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just want, give me food because I'm hungry and I have to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So timing is really, really important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Waqar, I see you're here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, Waqar.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I'm saying it right.
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you doing?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm doing great.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm doing great, Andy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been to a couple of spaces for almost like, you know, a couple of days on a routine level.
[SPEAKER_04]: Although I have been to Twitter from 2010, but I don't use it on that much kind of occasional level.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's been like, you know, two to three years that I know Timo and Kevin I'm sure they don't know that much about me, but because I like, you know, and I'm not available on Social media platforms and talking about the topic that you have the importance of timing it is a very profound topic and I'm 39 and What I believe is that there's a certain kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: element an innate element that is aligned with the Synchronicity of the universe everyone has got.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh What car we just lost you?
[SPEAKER_06]: X must have those problems yesterday, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no, what car okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll come back I'm gonna send you a speaker invite and we'll bring you back and
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll have to hop down now, so don't take the celebration thingies.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, have a great space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, bye.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fabio, how are you today?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go to Fabio.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey Andy, how's it going?
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, I just for now I I just wanted to say hi I do think that I have something on timing here, but the thought is not entirely Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just bring it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever you want to talk about.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I think that one thing that I've learned which is super super important is Timing is
[SPEAKER_07]: is necessary and like the placement of the right tools in front of people is also super necessary.
[SPEAKER_07]: What do I mean by this?
[SPEAKER_07]: When I started selling my ghostwriting services, I was very shy about like, OK, like I will follow up with this person, but I'll let them think about what I have offered them.
[SPEAKER_07]: And actually, once you are able to start talking to someone on a closer level, it is important to be, I'm not gonna say pushy, but you have to be fast.
[SPEAKER_07]: Things have a time.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that person might not have the same, let's put it, the same desire to buy from you after some time.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not saying that you have to push it again, but sometimes people just, I don't know what the word for this is, Andy, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_07]: Urgency.
[SPEAKER_07]: Urgency, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Urgency is a good one.
[SPEAKER_07]: The urgency changes for them.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think that timing is super necessary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your mother language?
[SPEAKER_07]: My mother language is Portuguese.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm from Brazil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know very little Portuguese, so I can't help you there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But next time I'll remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll, I'll try to, I'll try to throw in, if I can, the yes, urgency and immediacy of
[SPEAKER_01]: the problem, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you look at sales and marketing, it's always about solving a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever you're offering is a solution to somebody's urgent problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right when I do consulting their urgent problem is I just need somebody to shepherd this whole thing through I can't do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have enough time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need somebody now to help me and so then they Go, okay, Andy you your firm come give us somebody to help us do all that, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what my that's what my company does but
[SPEAKER_01]: When there's an issue, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just talk about software for a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, we're going to do a release We're going to put it into production When the software gets put in if it works great, everybody says woohoo and we go home But if we put the new software in and it doesn't work because that happens sometimes what do you do?
[SPEAKER_01]: well, then you have a group of people who engage the
[SPEAKER_01]: The architects the engineers the security people the whatever and they all Jump on a call and work together right at that moment Because right at that moment is when it's important not any other time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's important right then and so it's Urgent when you have a problem to In that situation to look at and fix it right now in the other ways but it's the same way when you're buying something
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, Christmas is coming shortly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Black Friday is in just three weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you get to Black Friday, which is the day after Thanksgiving, the largest shopping day of the year in the United States, that's when the majority of sales happen on those two days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Black Friday, then Saturday.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then a few days later on Cyber Monday, when everybody goes back to work and they have their computers and do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason it's Cyber Monday is because people didn't used to have internet at their house.
[SPEAKER_01]: They only had it at work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they would wait until they get to work and then they would order stuff online.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not true anymore, but they still call it Cyber Monday because there's always a big bump.
[SPEAKER_01]: The point is you better have all your stuff ready to go before Black Friday or on Black Friday when people are urgent, willing, and ready to buy.
[SPEAKER_01]: They won't buy your stuff, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the urgency when the sale is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thinking from the consumer's perspective, not from the sales perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, thanks Fabio, appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, are you in Brazil?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I currently live in Brazil.
[SPEAKER_07]: I used to live, when I was younger, I lived for two years in New York.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, unfortunately, we got back to Brazil.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, thank you for asking, my friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you are where you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can thrive wherever it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not a hindrance.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just asking because I was curious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where do you live?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome, because you're a question you're a For so right now it is is it almost noon 11 o'clock your time 11 a.m.
[SPEAKER_01]: Morning.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's exactly 12 p.m.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right now at 12.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay Yeah, I think that because like of the clock changes that happened this this past week Yeah, but um
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it would be 11 o'clock if it was a week earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think I would say you're on spot twice Andy Well, I live in california and so when you live in california it's kind of the the strange part of the world because
[SPEAKER_01]: In reality, on the West Coast of timing, there isn't anything really else.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are in this time zone, you are on the West Coast of the United States, and there isn't any other countries that are really in the same as the West Coast of the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just this time frame, whatever time frame this is on, is just this, well, not the United States, but it could be Canada, Mexico, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But the West Coast of North America,
[SPEAKER_01]: Has its own unique kind of time zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: There isn't anything else that happens at this time zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of strange If you're in if you're in the eastern time zone, that's halfway through south america Right if you but brazil is even further ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're five hours ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: New york is three hours ahead California is you know, 7 a.m in the morning now, so
[SPEAKER_01]: The only other place that's even stranger is like Hawaii time that Mid-pacific time zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's about it There's nothing else in that time for nobody else in the same kind of Frequency of time anyway, it's always interesting.
[SPEAKER_07]: I Find it too.
[SPEAKER_07]: And now that you said this I'm thinking like wow for how I for Hawaiians it might it must be hard like I
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it's you're absolutely right like there aren't that many people in places at the same time they are so things things uh are hard to uh uh I don't know hard to uh fit into other schedules at some points of the day yeah but uh Andy I I love I love talking about these topics so uh I appreciate the exercise because I know that I'm going to talk to my uh my brother he is in in uh uh
[SPEAKER_07]: Taiwan he's living there for for some months and I'm gonna talk to him about time zones because this is something we talk it's at times So yeah, thank you again if you Taiwan and and you got that's almost 12 hours difference yes, that's crazy, that's awesome, but Yeah, yeah exactly I'm going to sleep like he's waking up Yep
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thank you, Fabio.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go to T. Hi, T. I'm not sure we've spoken before.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, we haven't.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I've been listening in on your space as a listener quite often.
[SPEAKER_05]: When I joined this particular space, you were speaking about urgency.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it triggered something, which I used to be a building contractor.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I invented, in part,
[SPEAKER_05]: an acronym D-U-M-P, which spells a dump, unfortunately, with a C at the end.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so the D stands for disparity,
[SPEAKER_05]: if there's no difference between what they want to buy and what they already...
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so in the construction field, you have a lot of people just fishing.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're just calling up contractors, wasting everybody's time.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I worked off this thing of if there's no disparity, if there's no urgency,
[SPEAKER_05]: If there's no motive, if there's no payback, and if there's no consequence, you don't have a sale.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it never let me down in that
[SPEAKER_05]: when I was speaking to potentials, I would sort of build these five acronyms into a conversation.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if people fell down on one of them, disparity, urgency, motive, consequence, and payback, I just knew that they weren't serious, they were just fishing, and it was a waste of my time.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just thought I'd share that with the space.
[SPEAKER_05]: because it never let me down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to write them down, but if they had to have all five?
[SPEAKER_05]: They had to have all five because if there was no urgency, well, then what's the point?
[SPEAKER_05]: If there's no consequence for not building, I would say, well, what will happen if you
[SPEAKER_05]: don't go ahead with a project.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if there was like a wishy-washy answer, I would know, well, there's no consequence, or if their lounge was, let's say, 15 feet by 20 feet big, and they wanted like an extra meter added on,
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no real disparity, you understand?
[SPEAKER_05]: So each of these five is a critically important criteria to understand whether somebody is a serious buyer or if they're just fishing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's lovely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: How did you get it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it just
[SPEAKER_01]: Over time you just added another thing like oh, well, they've got everything except they they have no There's no big difference between the two to no disparity or they're or they're just fishing for tomorrow urgent How did you come up with that?
[SPEAKER_05]: those those particular kind of characteristics Yeah, um, I think
[SPEAKER_05]: I think, because I'm an avid reader, I think I may have read the first three somewhere in a loosely structured format, and then I put them into sequence, and that saw me through.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, when a person phoned me up, for instance, and said, Mr. X, would you please come and quote,
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd be there like a shot.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would interrogate them in the nicest possible way.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if they fell down, that was it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually said to them, look, perhaps I'm not the builder you're looking for and moved on to other prospects.
[SPEAKER_05]: I also am a great believer in Tom Hopkins because he was fantastic.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, he was a master salesman.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tom Hopkins.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, well, I might've heard that.
[SPEAKER_01]: What did he write a book or was he, did he, does he have a course?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does he talk?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there something he's famous for?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Tom Hopkins is famous for a book called how to master the art of selling anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh.
[SPEAKER_01]: I must have missed that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure I've read that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's that's kind of unusual that I had missed one, but it's not appreciate I'm gonna write it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, I just thought I'd share that with you guys Thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate that Where where are you right now?
[SPEAKER_01]: In South Africa in South Africa or or okay awesome Well, that's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: So
[SPEAKER_01]: I've worked in the northern part of the African continent in Egypt and other places near there, but never been down to South Africa or Zimbabwe or any of that, Botswana, anything way down that South.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never been there, but I think it's cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure, in a previous space I actually wanted to raise something that was appropriate then.
[SPEAKER_05]: The simple, oh yes, you were hosting a space about pricing and one of the truths which I discovered, and in fact I think it was part of Tom Hopkins, said that the price
[SPEAKER_05]: is always more important in the mind of the seller than the buyer.
[SPEAKER_05]: It prevents you from cutting your price and ending up
[SPEAKER_05]: working for nothing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the other one was people buy what they want, not what they need.
[SPEAKER_05]: So sort of armed with those two things, I had about an 89% hit rate.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it's all psychology at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's all I really have to say.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are absolutely right and spot on about the price in the mind of the buyer and the seller, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The seller, and we've often talked about this, the price that people think other people want to buy is typically constrained by what they have available in their own resources.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's not necessarily true for all your customers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some customers struggle to pay the price they pay for you, and other people, it's like buying a hamburger.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just go, yeah, okay, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they don't, it's just different.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, your job as a salesman is to make them wanted.
[SPEAKER_05]: You see, that turns the corner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Agreed, 100%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so we're gonna,
[SPEAKER_01]: the timing issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's twist this a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to know how to amplify the timing urgency.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make whatever you're selling, the absence of it, painful.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, if I'm selling food and I go, I'm sorry, we're closed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you're hungry, but we're closed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't sell you anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry that you're hungry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I point out the fact that you have a deficiency, like you were saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have that disparity between, I want this, I have this, I need this, I'm full.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you point it out, and keep pointing it out, pointing out the negatives.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is why negative ads work in politics, by the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not because we really hate other people.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's because we, they're pointing out how bad it will be if you do the wrong thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: By default,
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll want to do the right thing in their mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what the marketing is for right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what political admark We just went through a big election here in the United States a few days ago And so there was lots and lots of this kind of rhetoric flying around Go ahead Can I just object?
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if you've hosted a space on the ethics of sales because ethics are so important and that's why salespeople have a bad name because, well, or some people, some salespeople have a bad name because they're not approaching the sale
[SPEAKER_05]: from a point of ethic.
[SPEAKER_05]: If it was done to me, how would I feel?
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, my technique of disparity, urgency, motive, payback and consequence isn't a manipulative
[SPEAKER_05]: technique, it's finding out what the needs of the customer are and filling those needs.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there are people who actually say, well, you better buy it now because we won't have it available in stock in next week.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, that is totally unethical.
[SPEAKER_05]: So one treads a very fine line in sales.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it would be interesting if you haven't had a space to actually address the ethics of sales.
[SPEAKER_01]: I Don't think we have I know that will has He has a big perspective around the ethics of sales But I do not believe that we have actually had a discussion about that or talked about it with other people So that's an interesting topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe we'll bring that up in the next few days But I really appreciate you joining if you hello Christelle and Edwin Ben and
[SPEAKER_01]: Dan and others if you would love to talk we've got another 30 minutes left in the time zone of This space if you'd like to jump up and say hello while I'm guest hosting the sales and marketing mastery in the revenue Ronin Community I'd appreciate I would love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, begging.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on, please.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please somebody hit that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, I'm just gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: end up talking to myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I talked to Anthony.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like Anthony.
[SPEAKER_05]: As a final little joke, I wrote a book myself on sales.
[SPEAKER_05]: geared for the contractor's market.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was so excited, and I put it up on Amazon.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I realized, you know what an idiot I am, because builders are not readers.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's been the Amazon number one bestseller with no sales for the last five years.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's delightful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's pretty funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to share, and it's good to meet you too, I've not spoken to you before.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was gonna add about the topic, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Just one thing that came to my mind when I was thinking about this idea of timing, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because as you said earlier, Andy, people buy in the period of maximum pain, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I remember Mosey was talking about this a while back, and he was saying that the best time to get a testimonial is once you've delivered, but that's also the worst time to make an ask, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So when somebody's had a steak and they're full,
[SPEAKER_02]: they don't want another steak.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like half an hour earlier, they would have paid a lot for that steak.
[SPEAKER_02]: Half an hour later, they'd pay very little because it doesn't meet their need.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is, again, I think quite good for the topic of the space here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in your experience, Andy, how do you go about identifying when somebody is in the maximum pain so you can solve that problem in the best way possible?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the way that I do it is I ask people questions and typically what I try to do is ask them what is their current need.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way they describe their need will define to me their urgency.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, if they might say, remember, most of the conversations I have in this area are around, we have this problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need it fixed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So by the time they even talk to me, they have a problem, okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody talks to me, because I'm very expensive, and nobody talks to me about, oh, well, let's put you on retainer for the next five years.
[SPEAKER_01]: They go, no, we're cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll just wait until, oh, oh, man, we're, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got this new compliance thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to update this deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dang it, we need somebody to help us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, we'll call that Andy guy, okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: So when they call me and I talk to them,
[SPEAKER_01]: I ask questions like, okay, describe to me what you've got going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: How does this look for you?
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of duration do you think it's going to be?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have the team picked?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I ask them how far along on their onboarding of the project do they have?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then based on their answers, I can tell you how urgent they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've picked a team, we've got the contract, and we need somebody to help us get this stuff kicked off right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Urgent, need, instant.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're gonna start next week.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm starting to think, who do I call?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do I get them?
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of timing do I have?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I need to engage?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I get somebody else to engage?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the urgency that I see.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they say, well, we just heard that there's this new compliance thing
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're looking at vendors and we're doing, I'm like, okay, fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're in a, like a level one urgency out of 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: They know they need something.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not zero, but when it gets to a five, six, seven, that's when they hire me until then they don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so like T I just go, okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's what we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's how we do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I give them the, here's what you're going to get the outcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I give them the outcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to get this at the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you hire my firm, you get this thing when we're done.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the early stage of urgency.
[SPEAKER_01]: When the later stage of urgency comes, I give them the, okay, we can do this now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can get somebody there on Tuesday or we can, you know, whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just go right to tactics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Strategy when there's not urgent.
[SPEAKER_01]: When there's urgency, it's kind of like the food thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you want?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want Italian.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want Mexican.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to eat a steak.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want, I want tacos.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want a margarita, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just, you're, you're kind of hungry.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then there's the, I want bread now, or hungry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a whole different, that's, that's a fulfilled deliver now.
[SPEAKER_01]: and in the other things is give them the, which one is gonna give them the best experience and outcome, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think there's multiple stages in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did that answer your question, Will?
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely, I'm just trying to think of some podcast type questions for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we were talking about this timing, and it's really important for everybody, I believe, who's into sales and into this idea of service, because I've heard this said before, right, that the right product at the wrong time
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you can have the best product in the world, like you said earlier, but if it's at the wrong time, if it's after somebody's already bought or once they've already solved their pain, it's not useful anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't actually have the value.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason that this is so important, I think, especially when people are coming to the market now, is they'll spend too much time upfront developing the solution without actually knowing
[SPEAKER_02]: the ICP and the stage of the journey that they're in, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, if somebody is just starting up their business, they're in a prime position for a newsletter, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure you would agree because it's highest leverage.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if somebody already has multiple CRMs full of customers and potentially some newsletters in place, that service of how to set up a newsletter is going to be far less valuable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fair.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know what's funny?
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people, okay, there's, if you think of it, and we'll get to Christelle in a second, if you go from level zero to 100, where 100 is, you've mastered everything, you're like Hermosi, you have every nuance figured out how to monetize every possible step of every possible thing, or you're a zero of I wanna sell something and I don't know anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Each step along the way creates an opportunity to get better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people who have nothing need the zero to one talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: They need to go from I know nothing to I have 100% of step one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then people who are on step one need the talk of I know 100% of step one so I can go to step two, which is really like 10%.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they need to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thousand percent more but they can't go the thousand percent more of what they know because there is zero So you have to help everyone along the way getting a newsletter to people who have a big CRM full of stuff But don't focus on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hmm That's like way more money than helping people go from I know nothing and nobody to let me get a hundred people on my newsletter.
I
[SPEAKER_02]: I was trying to set Christelle up for a good show on newsletters there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the idea, I think what you sparked in me then, Andy, was this idea of an ascension model, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you can actually mitigate a lot of the time problems if you have different products for different people, or perhaps even the same product packaged differently for people on the different steps of the journey, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like mathematics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Math is math, but first grade math is numbers and adding and subtracting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fifth grade math is multiplication, division, and fractions, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: High school math can be algebra, et cetera, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a progression of knowledge, but it's stair steps on top of each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, let's go to Christelle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, Christelle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for joining.
[SPEAKER_01]: Appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took some notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, I came up because you asked for speakers, so here I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am in newsletter heaven right now, but I decided to take a break and come up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I have a couple of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hi, Andy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, Will.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, T. Haven't heard you before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, Danielle, Dan, Ryan, Fabio, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trishard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so a couple of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, best time for referrals is when you make the sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned this from a marketing coach.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's the best, one of the best marketing coaches I've had.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he says that is the time where they are most excited, you know, about working with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can say, hey, do you know anybody else that might be interested in this product as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I want to go back to what you were saying about the newsletter, because
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't want to just brush it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you were like throwing me a newsletter bone and I love it, but I want to build on it a little bit because it's a good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not really interested in working with the people that don't have a newsletter or starting from scratch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be, I shouldn't say I'm not interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very interested, but that's not my target.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will catch those people because I'm here on X. I'm on, you know, I'm in these,
[SPEAKER_00]: The newbies are going to hear me talking about it, but that's not my target.
[SPEAKER_00]: My target is actually the people that you mentioned, Will, that you might not think need a newsletter, because here's the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they've got CRMs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, they have a newsletter, but they're probably not using AI.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're probably not using Beehive.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're probably not using newsletter in the ways that we're using it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what I love about newsletters because it works for everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether you're a newbie and you don't have one, yes, you need one, and I'm here to show you how to get started all the way up to, yeah, we have newsletters and a massive email list, but are you really leveraging that and optimizing for growth and monetization?
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple more things and then I know you got your hand up, so I'm excited to hear from you all, but I have a little two more things.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing is I was praying on this this morning and Andy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I loved the conversation that sparked about persistence and this goes with the topic of, you know, the importance of timing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Persistence is so important because you never know when the time is going to come.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yesterday, Andy, you mentioned the example, you know, of of the prop of the it wasn't a proverb, but it was a scripture about really persistence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's another scripture about a woman going to the judge right over and over and over again, and the judge finally gives in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I just wanted to round that conversation out really quickly and say,
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just about faith like when we talk about faith, but we don't guide people to have faith in what it can be extremely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to say misleading, but it's like we're not closing out the loop by saying it's where are you putting your faith right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So these scriptures are in the Bible because it's saying have this type of persistence for your business, for your mission, for your purpose, but have faith in God because God is the highest level of faith that we can, you know, where we can put our faith because oftentimes we hear these messages and it's like faith in yourself, faith in yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm here to say that faith in myself never got me anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't until I started placing my faith specifically in Jesus Christ that my whole life started changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the last final thing, and I'm closing out landing this plane, but I'm going to hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is in response to T. T was asking about, you know, salespeople and the stigma and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: i was telling marcus my son's father this morning i can't wait to talk to you talk about you today because he's got this new sales job and i'm so impressed with him he works from home three days a week so i get to actually hear him on the phone and you know why what he does work because he's truly himself he tells people,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not trying to sell you anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want a cruise, I'm here to help you book it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here to help you get a discount.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can tell when they're on the other line kind of treating him like a salesperson.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, if you don't want it, that's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not here to sell you anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how we need to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, look, if you don't want what I have to offer, I'm not here to convince you because there's the next person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not an ego thing, but it's it's really like that's where the salesperson starts to feel like a salesperson is if they're pushing the person to buy something.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's not our job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our job is not to push.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's to establish credibility, establish authority, give amazing content so that people are coming to us like, I want what you have, I'm thirsty for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why am I thirsty for a newsletter?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I haven't made money and I've been on social media for 10 years and I haven't made a dollar or my business is not growing and a number of other reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, I'm landing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go to Tia and then Will.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was listening to Krista.
[SPEAKER_05]: And she said, the time for referrals, and then if I'm not correct, if I'm not mistaken, you were saying about asking people, so do you know anybody that might be interested in my product or service?
[SPEAKER_05]: which brought back something that Tom Hopkins said, that if you use the word anybody, they just have too many people in their mind, if you understand what I mean.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what he suggested was, if you found out that they belong to a sports club,
[SPEAKER_05]: say, is there anybody in your sports club that might be interested in my product?
[SPEAKER_05]: And that immediately narrows it down and they can pick out the people as opposed to anybody, which could be anyone in the world.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was just the one thing I wanted to say.
[SPEAKER_05]: But more importantly, one of the fundamentals of sales, which was drilled into my head when I started, was make no assumptions.
[SPEAKER_05]: about anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't know if the person's just won the lottery, if they've got Bitcoin, you know nothing about them.
[SPEAKER_05]: So one's not allowed to make any assumptions in sales.
[SPEAKER_05]: The only exception, the only assumption you're allowed to make is that you're going to get that sale.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you approach sales with that kind of a mindset, with making no assumptions about the person that you're with or assessing their needs, whatever, but the exception is that you are going to get that sale.
[SPEAKER_05]: And like I said earlier, it's all psychology and
[SPEAKER_05]: Sales is an amazing, it's a fantastic profession.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wish I was younger, but I really enjoyed it when I was in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Anthony.
[SPEAKER_01]: Appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go to Will.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'll back that up coming out of a 20 year sales career.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love, I love conversations and for me, selling and coaching are effectively the same skill set.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I get to keep doing what I love to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I had some points about what Christelle was saying, but they have fled my mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I would like to do instead, um, cause again, I was, I was talking about the whole, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: whole thing about the beginners right and this is what I wanted to bring to the table today that idea Christelle that if you have
[SPEAKER_02]: an ICP and a specific pain point that's leverageable at your level of expertise.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would imagine is people able with a budget to direct towards a networking or an email or what I'm looking for, newsletter list, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Then, because I've got this idea in my head recently, and I'm thinking about it more and more and more of this Ascension model, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do I help people go from zero to one and then from one to two, and then from three to four, maybe I'll work with people who are at five.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is thanks to Andy, right, who told me to focus on a bigger gym, so that's what I've been doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it gave me the idea that, Priscilla, have you written a book yet?
[SPEAKER_02]: about how beginners can get started with newsletters?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm working on it right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's it's literally writing my newsletter today to launch my 30 day challenge with the book.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to be doing it with other people because I thought I'm not the only one that needs a book.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yes, it's coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm working on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've talked about Daniel Priestley's model.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm using his model to build the authority business book.
[SPEAKER_02]: Amazing because yeah I was thinking more and more about this and you know as Ronins, all of us, I always want to get more feedback on these ideas because what I was thinking like I've just finished the first book right which is applicable to everybody
[SPEAKER_02]: But it crosses my mind, the people who are just starting out might even need more education as to why they need to optimize the mindset around this kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So is there another level beyond that that's even more broadly applicable?
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is just what's milling around in my mind right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I thought that was really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: The answer is, of course, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason why is because mastery is
[SPEAKER_01]: approaching infinity, but never reaching.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mastery is never perfect because as we know, if he starts a work in us, he says he will continue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Until when?
[SPEAKER_01]: He doesn't say until it's over, until you're done, until you're perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: He says every day you're getting closer and closer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the point about mastery and and I learned this specifically from my martial arts instructors is Every single level is like you said they're they're searching for the next thing they're searching for the next set of of
[SPEAKER_01]: expertise and mastery of whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to tell you a little secret about martial arts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ready?
[SPEAKER_01]: At the beginning it's punching and kicking.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the first day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every day after that is training your mind to overcome your body.
[SPEAKER_01]: So day one is punching and kicking and every other day, every single day after that is training you to control and manage your mind
[SPEAKER_01]: to overcome your body.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it doesn't matter if you're a sixth degree, which means you were, you trained to be a first degree and then you, the number of, this is universal.
[SPEAKER_01]: The number of years your belt is, is the number of years you have to train to get the next one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, if you're a 1st degree, you have to train a year to qualify to test for a 2nd degree.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a 2nd degree, you have to train two more years in order to get a 3rd degree.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a 3rd degree, you have to train three and so on, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're a 6th degree, that means you have trained for a minimum 25 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: 7th degrees, more.
[SPEAKER_01]: 8th degrees, more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every one of the people who are
[SPEAKER_01]: continuously training in the martial arts is continuously learning and attempting to become the best version of themselves somehow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, it is critical, critical that you understand you never truly arrive.
[SPEAKER_01]: You simply are awarded a milestone.
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't actually arrive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because when people start training in martial arts, and this applies to everybody, you start training in martial arts, there's a day when you decide, I'm a black belt.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's either the day they wrap it around you and say, I've achieved this milestone, or someday in the past that you think, if I just keep going, I'll become a black belt.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a black belt now, they just haven't wrapped it around my waist yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you are a first degree and you think, I'm a first degree black belt.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to be a second degree black belt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some point along the way you go, well, I'm a second degree black belt.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just haven't wrapped it around my waist yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I want to be a third degree?
[SPEAKER_01]: You just keep going and you can become a third degree black belt.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a third degree black belt and
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an interesting journey to look back, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: To look backwards and think, oh, that was the day I became a black belt.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't the day they wrapped it around my waist.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the day I decided, oh, I can do all this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just have to keep going until they wrap the belts around my waist.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's the same thing in sales.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the timing is, the timing goes like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I literally can teach anybody how to be a black belt.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a third degree black belt.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm certified.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been a black belt for years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have lots of credentials.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can teach anybody how to be a black belt.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, I can teach anybody how to punch and kick and defend themselves right now, but only when you're ready to learn how to punch and kick.
[SPEAKER_01]: I cannot force you how to become a black belt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hunger is easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody gets hungry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not everybody wants to be a black belt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe deep in their heart they want to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe they think it'd be cool if they were, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If I was a black belt then.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the truth is it takes time and it's a journey and not everyone's willing to go on the journey.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not everyone's willing to go on the journey today and at some point people go, I can't go on the journey anymore and fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the bottom line is, timing is the only reason why people become black belts.
[SPEAKER_01]: They choose to.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's because they want to and they've decided, I'm going to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the timing that's important.
[SPEAKER_01]: When they want to buy something, they decide, I want to buy this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to get a house.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need a mortgage to get a house because most people don't, like 99% of people, don't have enough money to write a check for a house.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they do, they probably will get a mortgage anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: The point is,
[SPEAKER_01]: They decide, I want a house.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they go through the process to get a house.
[SPEAKER_01]: The importance of timing is critical to success in sales and marketing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a salesperson, if you can imagine that they will always buy from you, eventually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe they're in that early stage of, I don't understand exactly what's happening, or can you explain the process, because I've never gone through this before, so I don't know what to expect.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of those things are critical and important to the sales process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And remember, marketing is just getting attention from people you know or don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing more to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Marketing is getting their attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sales is converting that attention into becoming a customer.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is nothing more than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is everything with sales.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is simply converting people's attention to becoming a customer.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Marketing is getting attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sales is converting them to becoming a customer.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you add more to that, you'll dilute.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll dilute it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll dilute your focus.
[SPEAKER_01]: So timing is on their end.
[SPEAKER_01]: Urgency, their end.
[SPEAKER_01]: Price and discussion, it's their end.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Chris Doe, do you guys know who Chris Doe is?
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got just a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chris Doe sells, he has a company called The Future, F, without the U, F-T-U-R-E, I think it is, or F-U-T-R without the E, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, great, fantastic, amazing teacher.
[SPEAKER_01]: Listen to him.
[SPEAKER_01]: His whole point is, when I sell services to other people, it's about what they need and what we deliver for them, not how much it costs me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most people, when they talk about things that are outside of their normal world, they instantly wonder, how much does it cost?
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you live in the world, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I live in the software organizational groups and large groups of people world.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no giant software system that gets delivered for a hundred bucks, except a hundred bucks per person on like vibe coding system to one people at a time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you sell Microsoft Office to a organization, it's millions of dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's probably millions of dollars over a couple of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just a different world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not better, worse, different.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when they need it, they buy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: When they need an upgrade, they just choose how much money they're spending on what they want.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so dealing with million dollar contracts is just what world do you live in?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The urgency of the customer is the most important thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, let's go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Danielle hasn't spoken yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to give you, if you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: to take the mic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Feel free.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Danielle being quiet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, what day is this?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, truth be told, I was not coming on today because I have a whole slew of things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I saw that you were hosting in lieu of Justin.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, well, I'm coming into support, but a lot of support there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Me being quiet.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like double dutying
[SPEAKER_01]: You're here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You took the mic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for my follow-out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the peeps are in the house.
I mean, look at that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got Will co-hosting.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got Christelle speaking.
[SPEAKER_03]: I loved what she had to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Edwin and Fabio and Dan.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've been having, I've been seeing, I've been having these extra, I don't want, oh, I should say extramarital.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Extracurricular conversations.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been on with Dan on Zoom.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been on with Fabio.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm having a life on X after X.
[SPEAKER_03]: Love it, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: I gotta get me some Cristal, though.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I gotta do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything he's doing, I gotta connect with you, girl, in a meaningful way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no, everything's good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just, yeah, life is in session in a good way, so I'm just double-dutying it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what's so cool?
[SPEAKER_03]: About five minutes ago, I'm getting inboxed from LinkedIn.
[SPEAKER_03]: Guys, if you're not on LinkedIn, get on LinkedIn.
[SPEAKER_03]: It does take a minute, just like it does on X, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't become instantly familiar with everybody, nor are they you.
[SPEAKER_03]: But people are now booking me and someone just asked me to do a keynote on January 15th.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's that's a minute away.
[SPEAKER_03]: I look.
[SPEAKER_03]: Guess what?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm already booked for another keynote on January 15th.
[SPEAKER_01]: Congratulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, that's the only one I'm booked for in January.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, I'm like, that's a good sign when people are reaching out and you're already booked like four months in advance.
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe they can move the date and it would be kind of cool because it might give me an opportunity to be in New Jersey, which I would love.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but yeah, I'm just, I'm just working over here, but I'm, I'm on the sidelines because I love to start my day with the daily jokes of my friends on X.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do, we were, uh, we've run out of time for this episode today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go to Christelle and then we'll, and then we'll all close this up for the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I, I got to figure out how to do that.

[SPEAKER_01]: Later today, I'm doing a space on branding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by the way, Danielle, or Christelle, yesterday you said, oh, and Andy is all about branding space.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: All about branding.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that better than what I've said before.
[SPEAKER_01]: I even sent you a DM.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't get that DM because I forgot that I even said that so thank you now I am all All about branding.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you said yeah, and Andy's all about branding thing at noon.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, yeah, I like that So anyway, I so shout out to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for that The importance of timing it cannot be understated
[SPEAKER_01]: you can have the greatest offer in the world and the greatest food in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they've just finished a steak, nobody wants it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody wants a second one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw that podcast too and I thought, oh, that's so, that is perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the sales and marketing, marketing is getting attention and sales is converting them to being a customer.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you operate
[SPEAKER_01]: in your mind as if you are helping people get what they want, like Zig Ziglar said.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by the way, I think I've read every single Zig Ziglar book, which is a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Helping people get what they want will let you get all the things that you want, but you have to help them get what they want first.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that, we're gonna end today's sales and marketing mastery.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're gonna end up, and at the end of the day, Justin asked four questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm simply gonna say come back again tomorrow and we'll see you then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, take care, have a great day, bye-bye.
