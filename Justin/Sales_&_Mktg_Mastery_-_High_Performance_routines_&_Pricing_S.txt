[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, my friends, welcome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome, my friends.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's Wednesday, Wisdom Wednesday, as we like to call it around here.
[SPEAKER_05]: So thanks for being here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good to see you, Christelle.
[SPEAKER_05]: Really enjoyed the Mastermind yesterday.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, great to see you.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, we got Vivi, we got Asa, we got Christelle, we got Edwin.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good to see you, Edwin.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hope you're well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Really enjoying your stuff on LinkedIn.
[SPEAKER_05]: Edwin, so yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Great, great to have you guys aboard here.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're in the startup circle today, so we do these spaces, you know, Monday, Wednesday, Friday, 645 AM Pacific in the startup circle and Tuesdays and Thursdays in the revenue road in community.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, great to have you guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: Great to have you guys here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Vivi, I know you'll like this topic.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know it's.
[SPEAKER_05]: not the best time for you, this space, but it's the only time I can do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's why we, you know, and there's a reason why I did 645 AM Pacific in the very beginning, because, you know, just in case I had a job or I had client work or whatever, that I could still make sure that I showed up for the community.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so this is the best time.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, but thanks for being here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Christo.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you wanna co-host, let me know, I can throw you the invite.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, cool, awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so today's topic, guys, is, it's a big one, high performance routines.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm continuously asked, you know, hey, Justin, what's your routine like?
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've been talking to some people that I used to work with, you know, colleagues, former colleagues of mine on LinkedIn.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, they've been seeing my uptick in
[SPEAKER_05]: metrics.
[SPEAKER_05]: They've been seeing an uptick in activity, in impressions.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're like, wow, what are you posting five times a day?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, no, three.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm posting three times a day.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll share with you a screenshot just so you can see the performance and the data here.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the thing is, I've been on a kick here in October specifically.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been on a kick here in October specifically focused on
[SPEAKER_05]: increasing the frequency, increasing the quality, and the velocity, and the quantity of posts, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all I've been doing for all of October, and this is the result so far.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the point is, if you want to
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to get more visibility, visibility plus credibility equals profitability.
[SPEAKER_05]: Visibility plus credibility equals profitability.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the formula.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the formula.
[SPEAKER_05]: If that's something you want for yourself, for your business, then just keep it real simple.
[SPEAKER_05]: Increase your quality, increase your frequency, increase your velocity, and quantity.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Alex Ramosi and I think it was Mr.
[SPEAKER_05]: Beast was talking to somebody like a short clip.
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw a short clip and he asked the guy, he's like, wow, you guys got to 30 million followers.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, how'd you do that?
[SPEAKER_05]: And the guy said, I posted a hundred times a day, a hundred times a day.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You heard that right.
[SPEAKER_05]: A hundred times a day.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, I'm not saying you have to go this hard.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not saying you, you know, but the point is, is like, this is the level of mastery and high performance, like, you know, that's out here.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you want that, you just gotta do more.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was talking to Andy about this the other day, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: The point is, we can always do more.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can always be more.
[SPEAKER_05]: we can always become more, we can always handle more, you know, abundance thinking, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Abundance thinking.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's, that's the main takeaway.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll be breaking it down today.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll share with you like some high performance routines that I do that maybe will be helpful for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd love to hear from you like, Hey, this is my high performance routine, what I do.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, we can get the discussion going.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, um, but yeah, let's check in with Christelle real quickly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Christelle, good morning.
[SPEAKER_05]: How are you today?
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, good morning.
[SPEAKER_06]: Happy Wednesday, Winter Wednesday, Wisdom Wednesday, Hump Day Wednesday, anyone.
[SPEAKER_06]: Happy to be here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Really appreciated the session last night, even though I was so tired.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was Zooming from the couch and entertaining my child somehow at the same time.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, it was it was amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm so grateful you moved it earlier.
[SPEAKER_06]: Could you imagine if you had it at nine?
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think I would have been awake.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like it just would have been
[SPEAKER_06]: No good.
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you for that time adjustment.
[SPEAKER_06]: That helped a lot because I was actually able to be present, although at my, you know, tiredness.
[SPEAKER_06]: But so, yeah, I'm just so grateful this morning to be a part of this mastermind in this community.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I try to come as often as I can.
[SPEAKER_06]: Luckily, the dev meeting today doesn't start until 45 after.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah, it's going to be good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Looking forward to the convo.
[SPEAKER_06]: high performance routines and pricing strategy.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's level up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, it's level up day today.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's level up today.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm feeling inspired and I'm pretty inspired every day, to be honest, on X and when you have community, right, Christelle?
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, so guys, please like and repost the space.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you have questions, you know, feel free to raise your hand.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, this is a mastermind discussion here.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, you know, feel free to grab the mic and share.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'd love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_05]: And let me invite Christelle to co-host here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure where Andy is, but we'll keep pressing on.
[SPEAKER_05]: So today's space is sponsored by Play.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Play is an actual paying sponsor of the space, and they're an AI ad that I use, my clients use, and it helps us run ads 10 times more efficient and effective than just running ads on the native platform itself.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a great tool.
[SPEAKER_05]: I use it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I said, my clients use it, and it's how, you know, we get better results and performance of the ads using AI.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's built on chat GPT.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's built by former engineers and ad specialists at Google and Facebook.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what better tool is built by somebody who's actually been in the trenches of Google ads and Facebook ads, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So definitely check it out.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to highlight it in a second here so you guys can check it out.
[SPEAKER_05]: But supporting the sponsor means supporting the space.
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, they are a paying sponsor.
[SPEAKER_05]: So please like and repost the space would really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's gonna be a lot of value here dropped as usual.
[SPEAKER_05]: And look, we just want you to win.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to if you want to attend a space that's going to help bring in more money into your bank account and help you grow as a person like you're in the right space.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is what we're all about here.
[SPEAKER_05]: In the startup circle and community.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all about leveling up.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all about
[SPEAKER_05]: teaching you strategies and tactics to help bring in more revenue.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what we're all about.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, and I'm really on a big mission to help 1000 fellow Ronins on this journey towards sales and marketing mastery.
[SPEAKER_05]: And why sales and marketing mastery?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because sales and marketing are the two biggest business drivers of any company.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not product, it's not accounting,
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not finance.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not operations.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not customer service.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are part of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the true biggest business drivers of any company is sales and marketing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you really don't have a business until you make a sale, until the money comes into your bank account.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, that's my hot take.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I appreciate you guys being here.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I have pinned to the Jumbotron
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I have pinned to the Jumbotron, the sponsor, so definitely check that out.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, let's go over to you real quick, Christelle, to kick us off, and then we'll keep the conversation going.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good to see you, Antonio.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's our newest Ronin member, so good to have you, and we're playing around with this idea, just a heads up, in the Ronin community.
[SPEAKER_05]: We may have, we may have, I'm talking about it right now,
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm thinking about it of implementing a bonus for any Ronin's that sign up.
[SPEAKER_05]: So for any Ronin that's on any plan, I'm thinking about doing a one, one hour call a month where people can come in around lunchtime and ask me anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I charge $500 an hour.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll send you the invoice, but that's what I charge my clients.
[SPEAKER_05]: and my corporate clients and, you know, pretty much anyone that wants time with me, like one-on-one, like they're like, Justin, I need to schedule a call with you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, great.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I charged $500 an hour and it's prepaid.
[SPEAKER_05]: I do prepaid.
[SPEAKER_05]: Why?
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause I don't, I don't want to chase invoices, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not in the invoice chasing business.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm in the business transformation business, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what a business consultant does.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we're thinking about,
[SPEAKER_05]: implementing this in the coming months so more to come on that but Antonio hopefully that's you know good news in your ears to hear that because again part of the bonus would be one time a month you could come ask me anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right let's go over to Christelle and uh and yeah I would love to hear from anyone please grab the mic we'd love to hear from you you know ask questions this is what we're here for and uh yeah okay
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I sent out a few invites, so hopefully we'll get some more speakers.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if not, Justin, I'm just going to ask you the questions because, yes, I'm very much looking forward to the office hour.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's going to be so good.
[SPEAKER_06]: But also, you all, Justin is here every day, Monday through Friday.
[SPEAKER_06]: and he's going to continue right that's the alpha i'm bringing you all alpha from the mastermind he's continuing this into 2026 which makes me a very happy woman because this is a huge part of my life and i often think about it justin like what will i do i'm sure i'll be okay but
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I'm like, I hope he'll give us plenty of warning time if he decides to end this.
[SPEAKER_06]: So anyways, he's not ending.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to keep going.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't need to think about that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm very happy.
[SPEAKER_06]: But also, you know, we can ask Justin and Andy and any of the speakers up here the right questions, and you're going to squeeze the best alpha out of them.
[SPEAKER_06]: So please come up here.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, Justin, I have a question for you.
[SPEAKER_06]: that I'm hoping will squeeze some good alpha.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know it'll squeeze some good alpha out of you and it's related to the topic.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to say hi to Andy, of course, and Phoenix, and Trishard, and Antonio, and Edwin, and everyone that's in the space.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for sharing it, DMing it.
[SPEAKER_06]: We appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, Justin, I'm going to give you a little time to go grab that link.
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember the Revenue Ronin AI link?
[SPEAKER_06]: We want to put that up so that we can talk about it and promo it and shill it for you on your behalf.
[SPEAKER_06]: Justin is creating something amazing, an AI basically of his mind.
[SPEAKER_06]: as well as he can do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yeah, and he's got a newsletter.
[SPEAKER_06]: So make sure that you're supporting him.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's lots of ways to support.
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, you can become a revenue Ronan and come to the mastermind, which is amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had it last night.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so here's my question.
[SPEAKER_06]: You've been talking about this, and Andy has this too.
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe we can squeeze, you know, the alpha out of both of them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you share with us the high level
[SPEAKER_06]: of what this content system looks like.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've heard about it, and it's amazing, you know, to get this content volume that you're pushing out for October, because we see the results.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's the end of October, almost, not even quite, and we're seeing
[SPEAKER_06]: this amazing green graph that's just going up and I'm seeing you all over LinkedIn too and I barely go in there but when I do it's like Justin's at the top of my feed so I know it's working so maybe you could share with us you know the high level of what you're doing this what the workflow looks like you know the tools whatever you want to share because I'm sure that would be very helpful to people.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah you got it so and you know in all honesty like
[SPEAKER_05]: It's somewhat inspired by Andy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got to give credit where credit's due because, you know, I've been learning a lot from Andy over the course of the last, you know, year that I've known him like over a year.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, and yeah, I've always been posting content on X and LinkedIn.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those have been my main platforms, but it wasn't until like October where I really just.
[SPEAKER_05]: Andy really inspired me to get off my butt and just set up Claude in a way where it's like systemized, where you have a project and you have your knowledge base fully built out.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a knowledge base is essentially, all that is, is just, you know, it has my resume, it has my websites, it has my case studies, it has information that, you know, a basic knowledge base around the content
[SPEAKER_05]: that and prompts as well, prompts as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: So not only the knowledge base, but also prompts.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then that is part of my cloud project that sits in a folder.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so anything that you request, any prompt that you request references, all of those documents that that's essentially the foundation is making sure you have a project
[SPEAKER_05]: and a knowledge base of content.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it has that context, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: It has that context.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, funny thing is, you know, Gary Vaynerchuk, to his credit, you know, I've met him three times actually, by the way.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, and yeah, he's an awesome guy, you know, very inspiring.
[SPEAKER_05]: And why I kind of got into digital marketing was because I saw one of his talks back in like 2008.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's like, yeah, if you're doing something you hate, like you got to do something you love.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm like, yeah, I don't like it anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to get into Disney.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that kind of inspired me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, but the point is, is once you have your knowledge base.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Context.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there, there's a quote that he says that's really important.
[SPEAKER_05]: Content is King, but context is God.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Content is King, but context is God.
[SPEAKER_05]: And because of these context windows of the LLMs, some of them are limited.
[SPEAKER_05]: But they're widening.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're widening.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the more you can feed it for your knowledge base, the better.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I like to update it only once a month, because you can't just upload it every single day.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just going to be too much.
[SPEAKER_05]: So once you have your project, and I use Cloud for this, and I pay the $20 a month,
[SPEAKER_05]: You have your project, you have your knowledge base.
[SPEAKER_05]: So all the documents, your resume, your cover letter, like everything, your prompts, and then you have the key prompt.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is like really the secret sauce where I've basically pre-programmed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I say, based on this transcript, which I record in, in zoom every single day, a video in three and 10 minutes long, depending on the topic.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I record the Zoom video and then I take the transcript from the Zoom video and I copy and paste it into my main prompt document.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then what it does is it uses all that knowledge base and context to create 14 pieces of different content.
[SPEAKER_05]: And those include LinkedIn personal page, LinkedIn company page,
[SPEAKER_05]: Facebook business page, Facebook personal page, Instagram, threads, TikTok, YouTube, Spotify, Pinterest, and I'm forgetting some more, but the point is it's 14 different pieces.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Substack, my newsletter, a blog post, Beehive newsletter, all those things.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I have all the content.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I share it with my VA, and then she goes and, you know, post it or schedules it accordingly.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that's the entire system.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've really perfected that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the first time, the first few days I did this, it took me four hours.
[SPEAKER_05]: It took me four hours.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now I've got it down to about 30 to 40 minutes.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, that's the- Ooh, Justin.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is so good.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope people I knew you would give us the best alpha and you're right.
[SPEAKER_06]: This I got inspired from this through just through Andy and then you did it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm so glad you did.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for sharing with us.
[SPEAKER_06]: I did take notes.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll try to clean them up and put them in the trouble for anyone that didn't hear the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is my second or third time hearing it, but I need to.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the fire I needed under my bum.
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, welcome to the stage.
[SPEAKER_05]: Andy, good morning.
[SPEAKER_05]: How are you doing?
[SPEAKER_05]: We've been talking about the results of my content system that I've been doing for October, because the metrics are just incredible.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm getting DMs from people.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm getting former colleagues reaching out to me like, whoa, Justin, we see you everywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: What are you doing?
[SPEAKER_05]: They want to know, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: They want to know.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the main question is, is that turning into revenue?
[SPEAKER_05]: And yes, it did turn into revenue, $250 to be specific, because a former colleague reached out and she's like, wow, Justin, I don't know what you're doing, but I need to learn from you.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I wasn't expecting this, but she sent me a check for $250, which was a half hour because I spent a half hour with her and I told her what I charge.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so she sent me a $250 check.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the point is visibility
[SPEAKER_05]: plus credibility equals profitability.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the formula.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the formula.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Andy, good morning.
[SPEAKER_05]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, good morning.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you're good.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK. Congratulations on your content system.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's similar to what I do.
[SPEAKER_04]: I built
[SPEAKER_04]: my content system so that it could run on whichever LLM I choose it to because I built it in a way that with the intention that I would help, I would use it to produce content for other people as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I built the entire thing because I needed an editor.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the reason was because I decided I was going to write articles on my blog about a year and a half ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: And very shortly I realized, first of all, very shortly I ran out of ideas what to say.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the second thing is I ran out of a good way to write.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a tendency to repeat myself and say things over, which is very good when you're talking, but not necessarily when you're writing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had to figure out a better way to edit, and I used AI to edit it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then once I realized I could edit the things from my blog, which you can find in my bio, and now has 2.6 million page views, I get between 50,000 and 100,000 a month on average.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's with almost no effort.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what I did was I
[SPEAKER_04]: reverse engineer the whole thing, which I've told you the story before, but the bottom line is you have to define your voice, and then you have to choose an audience, and then you have to describe the problems you solve.
[SPEAKER_04]: I call them your superpowers, the problems you solve.
[SPEAKER_04]: And using that methodology, those three pieces, I built
[SPEAKER_04]: a sequence of prompts that will take those things, add in a seed phrase, put in the specific grammar for what I'm trying to accomplish, and then I have a set of templates that I've refined over the years that have, this one is what the newsletter, this is the best newsletter one, this is the best LinkedIn post methodology, and they're not static.
[SPEAKER_04]: They kind of rotate.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I built all of those as a sequence of prompts.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I have Zap that runs the prompts in order.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it creates the output.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I, well, it's in an Excel sheet to start with, or a Google sheet.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you just run the macro and it captures all the, it assembles, what I call it, assembles the entire prompt.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you just grab the prompt and run it through
[SPEAKER_04]: any of your favorite LLMs and it will produce output.
[SPEAKER_04]: And once a month, I run it through every single LLM I see because they all are being updated and change and whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I also have a prompt that says, check this output against this set of criteria, kind of like a QA prompt.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so all of that together,
[SPEAKER_04]: You can put in anybody's voice, anybody's audience, anybody's superpower.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can put in the platform you want it to go in.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can change the grammar.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can update the system.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you can check it against what your criteria is.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can produce almost any type of content talking about almost any type of topic.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you run it on the LLMs that have access to the current internet,
[SPEAKER_04]: then you can put in another thing that says, check these things against blah, blah, blah, and then write them that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what happens.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so mine is just, if you think about technology, every single thing on the internet, everything that you see, everything that you're on your phone is literally just a bunch of text that was compiled into something
[SPEAKER_04]: with a graphical piece on top of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so with the AI tools, I simply created a kind of a programmatic way of a systemized set of prompts to produce a text output to generate something I want to read for the picture.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I put that on all the different platforms.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's it, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've talked about
[SPEAKER_04]: And the lever is your voice, defining your voice so it's personalized in your voice, and then picking an audience, customized for your audience, and then talking about the problems that you solve.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you do that and you post the results of that, if you think about what it is, you write about what that stuff is, you then post that consistently over time.
[SPEAKER_04]: You end up with crazy numbers like I have, which is,
[SPEAKER_04]: millions of page views and millions of engagements on X. Yeah, it's huge, Andy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and, you know, I'm excited to hear about, you know, the proposals you're working on for executives, because there's a direct correlation, as Andy's pointed out, and the research backs it up that executives that have, you know, million dollar companies,
[SPEAKER_05]: if they want to increase the valuation of that company, they need to have a personal brand.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a direct correlation and the data points that out.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so this is why executives need a personal brand on top of, you know, their company brand stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, um, and his system, you know, is, is brilliant and you know, it's an investment for them.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an investment and it's going to increase the valuation of the company, especially if they want to,
[SPEAKER_05]: look towards merger or acquisition in the near future.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, and then to your point, Andy, last thing I'll say is it's okay to say things multiple times, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like even if you have a blog post, like you can take that blog post and then you can have the AI write 10 different versions of that blog post.
[SPEAKER_05]: So now you have 10 different articles.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the point is people need to, and this is a big reminder that people need to understand,
[SPEAKER_05]: Just because you posted a piece of content on LinkedIn, like two months ago, doesn't mean you can't share the same piece of content again today.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: 99.5% of the people didn't see it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And even if they did, they see it again.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, I think I saw that like last month from Justin.
[SPEAKER_05]: Who cares?
[SPEAKER_05]: The, the, the benefits outweigh the negatives.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: The benefits outweigh the negatives.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you need to be more visible.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Your visibility plus your credibility equals profitability.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the more visible you can be with your content, the better.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, just just increase the frequency, increase the quality, increase the quantity and increase your velocity.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then when people log in and they're like, wow, I see Christelle everywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: I see Andy everywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: I see Justin everywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: I see Timo everywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm getting his newsletters too, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just, wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: What, what does this offer?
[SPEAKER_05]: What does he do?
[SPEAKER_05]: What is he selling?
[SPEAKER_05]: And then this is the final thing I'll say, and then we'll go back to Christelle and I want to hear from Timo.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, people will end up being curious on, wow, what is Timo's offer?
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I see all this great content about.
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, human skills and I see, you know, poker references on, you know, high performance habits and all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like what is Timo's offer?
[SPEAKER_05]: What does he do?
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: What can, what can I buy from him?
[SPEAKER_05]: How can I invest in his solution, his high ticket offer for, you know, beehive set up and, uh, you know, workflow automation, email automation.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like what, what does that look like?
[SPEAKER_05]: They'll naturally be curious because seeing you everywhere,
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just a natural progression.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's that's the main takeaway.
[SPEAKER_05]: So so go ahead, Christelle.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you have any follow ups here or any any questions?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, this is so good.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just want to share a little bit about what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm going to basically combine everything I'm learning into one, like we're going to have a super system.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because what I'm doing is I have a set of interview questions that I'm asking my client.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this I've been doing for about a year now, but I'm refining it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So for instance, right now I'm starting a newsletter with one of my clients, the one that has the nonprofit and the startup and her personal brand.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's really a newsletter.
[SPEAKER_06]: that's going to highlight all three of these areas.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what I'm doing is I'm using Manus and I'm saying from the very, very beginning, this is what I want you to know about this client.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the goal.
[SPEAKER_06]: Tell me step by step the best practices for starting a newsletter with her.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I have it give me questions to ask her to get it started.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're starting with the vision.
[SPEAKER_06]: Always start with the vision.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're very vision based questions.
[SPEAKER_06]: I did this with her yesterday and we had about an hour, almost two hour long call talking about the vision and going so deep.
[SPEAKER_06]: because of these five questions that Manus came up with.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it and it's funny because when it started, she didn't even want to do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: She was tired.
[SPEAKER_06]: She had been awake all night.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I offered for her to maybe do it later when she had more energy.
[SPEAKER_06]: But she's like, no, it's OK. And then, you know, before we know it, we're like on the call for two hours.
[SPEAKER_06]: We scheduled it for 30 minutes.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it was an amazing conversation, and now I take that two-hour transcript, which is her gushing over the vision and us masterminding over it, because I'm giving feedback and I'm like, wow, that's powerful, I'm learning more about the vision, I'm getting excited, you know, and all that's in a transcript now, and I'm going to use that to now go create
[SPEAKER_06]: the brand profile, the strategy, the newsletter strategy, the content pillars, the content plan.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you don't take anything else out of this, use the transcripts to create content, whether it's your self-recording video, which is what I need to start doing.
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you, Justin, that was the big takeaway.
[SPEAKER_06]: I need to start doing that.
[SPEAKER_06]: for my own branding content, but also I want us to think about how we can work with our community members, you know, our clients, find other people to create content with because it becomes an amazing conversation.
[SPEAKER_06]: And now you have amazing content and not just content, but you can create plans and templates and strategies and all the things.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you just triggered something we haven't done and you know what we need to do?
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a whole bunch of people on here and a whole bunch of people with newsletters It's a shame that we don't guest write for each other Yeah, absolutely, this is something Ani and I just started talking about a couple days ago We're like she invited me to come right on her newsletter and I'm getting so every day I'm getting subscribers because Ani is recommending me on beehive to her newsletter like I don't even write newsletters as much anymore and
[SPEAKER_06]: So, but I'm starting to, cause I feel like I need to do better as a teacher.
[SPEAKER_06]: I even upgraded.
[SPEAKER_06]: So now they're getting my money again.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, because yeah, you all inspire me Timo too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I actually read your newsletter.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're right, Andy, we need to do this and we need to collaborate more.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Justin, we need to have some sort and Andy Timo, we need to put some sort of zoom together.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's just what I'm sensing, you know, hour long masterclass we can,
[SPEAKER_06]: sponsor it from all our communities, but in an hour we could show this and build something really incredible.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I like that idea and we need to book it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Myself, Andy, and then we'll go to Timo, sorry man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Myself, Andy, Justin, the job father, and Sherilyn were on a live two weeks ago on a Sunday,
[SPEAKER_05]: and it was awesome it was streamed to x live and also linkedin and yeah we got some really good content there like from the transcript and then also from opus video clips like short clips so that was awesome and yeah i think collaborations is yeah it's like it's one thing to do my daily content by myself
[SPEAKER_05]: But I really enjoy collaborations, to your point.
[SPEAKER_05]: And guest posts is part of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know Timo's been doing some guest posting with the startup circle and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, a good indicator.
[SPEAKER_05]: Christelle, we can always do more.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can always be more.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can always learn more.
[SPEAKER_05]: So good call out there, Andy and Christelle.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go over to Timo, because we've been hogging the mic here.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Timo, what's going on, man?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, when you have four people on the panel,
[SPEAKER_02]: Just three people talking looks great Good morning guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey The time difference is just killing me.
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, I'm always kind of almost missing this
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, I had a long day at work.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just got out of the last meeting and hopped right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and yeah, my newsletter emails are coming later than you wanted to.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're kind of missing the, it's coming like, I think it's like 1 a.m. for East Coast that they pop for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's kind of bad, but I hope you guys are on this weird thing of turning time.
[SPEAKER_02]: backwards soon so we can get back to the normal rhythm.
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyways, there's a fresh new email newsletter for you to go and read and click on the ads.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, so hey Christelle, that's awesome that you are back on the, are you on the paid plan again?
[SPEAKER_02]: So start earning.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, Kevin is pulling four figures out of the ad revenue.
[SPEAKER_06]: So is Ani, did you see her post?
[SPEAKER_06]: She's made over a thousand dollars.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but that's total, but Kevin is at the point that he's doing around 50 to 70 bucks per email.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing 20 to 30 bucks per email now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, it's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't be hitting four figures yet, but I'm already close to 200 for this month.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, it's why wouldn't you pay the 50 to get that money?
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, so about routines.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I read the data from all my surveys that I've done with the people, the readers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of rescheduled and restructured my newsletter.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the routine now is Monday, Wednesday, Friday.
[SPEAKER_02]: Monday and Wednesday are kind of like short primers, free for everyone, open to internet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyone can go and read them.
[SPEAKER_02]: No need to even give the email, just go and read it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the Tuesday and Thursday are the longer versions of those primer emails that then just take a deeper dive into specifics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the paid members also get possible tools from my
[SPEAKER_02]: career and project management stuff or whether there are prompts or something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's how I roll nowadays.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you have been reading the newsletter and you have noticed that this week I also implemented YouTube videos on them and they are explanatory YouTube videos from those articles.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I now do, I write the article, I let the LLM make it better
[SPEAKER_02]: better in language and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I throw each article into Notebook LM and I make a brief video for the Monday, Wednesday and Friday.
[SPEAKER_02]: Friday is kind of like the collection of what we did that week.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes around a minute and a half to three minute long video.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then for Tuesday and Thursday.
[SPEAKER_02]: I create somewhere around seven minute long video and I have a pretty long prompt.
[SPEAKER_02]: a prompt wireframe that I then ask the Cloud project that has all the data from my newsletter to manage it so that it reflects good on YouTube, hits the keywords and whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now I'm just posting an email newsletter with a YouTube video on a brand new YouTube channel and
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they're getting views.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, nothing spectacular, but I started doing this
[SPEAKER_02]: Like this week and I haven't been mentioning mentioning about it, and I'm already and the top video has What 12 15 views or something like that?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like nothing, but still it it kind of is like your midday post here on X right now so so it's even better but
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm just looking and checking because it's totally automated.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not sweating too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do some editing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I use CapCut to do the subtitles and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So kind of cut some of the... And there's like a notebook LM logo at the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll just edit that out.
[SPEAKER_02]: But other than that, I'm just...
[SPEAKER_02]: using AI to automate this entire system and who knows if I'm doing five videos per day and then during weekends I'm just doing
[SPEAKER_02]: the old articles that I have more than 120 of I'll just create those into videos and I'm just gonna turn that YouTube channel into a catalog of explainer videos from those articles and then I'm gonna channel people from the description to the newsletter and yeah who knows let's see what happens if that picks up at all or if YouTube just hates it because it's AI video but I don't know it's
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes me about five minutes, so it's not like a huge task and it has potential.
[SPEAKER_02]: So who knows?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just testing things and seeing what happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Justin, when it comes to that, I was talking to Vaughn last night for him, this morning for me, and he's probably going to be launching a beehive and I'm going to be helping him set it up and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, there's my high-tech offer going live.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good stuff, Timo.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Congratulations.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, and yeah, you notice that when Timo, when he started sharing, he said he looked at the data.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I want to point that out.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that this is a way guys, you got to start with data first, data, data, data, first data dictates the strategy.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you don't have data, well, you got to get some, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like when I launched an ad campaign, I'm running ads right now for a client.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh,
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, like, you know, phase one is testing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like we got to get some data first.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like before you scale up the, the campaign and the spend, you got to get some initial test data.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So once you have the data, then you can make decisions that, that will dictate the strategy and, and tactics, um, even more so.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good, good indication there, Timo.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's exciting on the high ticket.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, and yeah, congrats on the newsletter, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and like I said, you should start putting those ads too because it warms up the system.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to get the cheaper ones first, but then we're now doing what you guys were talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: We should be co-creating on each other's newsletter.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, me and Kevin and Oni have been kind of planning on this, not a PayPal mafia, but Beehive mafia, where we are kind of, we're basically daily strategizing with Kevin, testing things and doing Beehive nerding nowadays on Telegram.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were thinking about maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: starting a Telegram group where we can all nerd out about Beehive stuff and min-max the profits because it's a pretty good game.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we're now hitting these three to four dollars per click ads and I have two ads so if you go and click on those ads I earn six dollars from your two clicks so I really appreciate everyone who does that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really do appreciate you reading the newsletter actually more because I do put time and effort into it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hold on, we're about to be the three click mafia.
[SPEAKER_06]: The three, because basically when I see your ads, I'm just clicking.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just clicking because I'm like, I'm sending my friend money, sending my friend money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, that's what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, I have, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: I have, I'm subscribing to Kevin and Oni with two different emails and I use my Wi-Fi and my mobile for for both the different accounts and go to click so basically they're getting like 12 bucks out of my two subscriptions so yeah it's pretty good job and you can
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, it's fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm excited for what they have coming up on November 13th.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're gonna be introducing a whole lot of new tools and things, so I'm pumped.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's fun to build businesses and make money.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what it's all about at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is hard work too, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: i mean shout out to jim down below like you know he's shared with us the formula it's like hey 10 videos a day for two years drive them to your newsletter like that's it you know he shared with us the formula to 30k a month so yeah it's hard work but if you stick with it right and you're consistent you know you can do you can do the same right you can do the same so
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and yeah, like it all comes down to, you know, what is priority for you?
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, and I'll just share that this, this quote here that I pinned in the jumbotron entrepreneurship is living a few years of your life.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like most people won't so that you can spend the rest of your life.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like most people can't.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's the definition of entrepreneurship.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's straight truth right there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can follow my path, which is getting laid off at five different companies over the course of 15 years and still building your agency, which is what I did.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I put my personal brand on hold and I put my email list building on hold, like zero, zero.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that's why I've been hitting it hard for the last two years.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, people ask me like, why are you going so hard these last two years?
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's because I'm making up for lost time.
[SPEAKER_05]: If I had, if I had kept my foot on the gas of building my personal brand, building my email list, like other people that I was connected with, like I'd be a multimillionaire right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no question.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no question at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: The fact that I put those things on hold, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: and
[SPEAKER_04]: Consistency and targeting of the audience as a I continue.
[SPEAKER_04]: So here's the Step back look at the whole big picture real quick, and then we'll go to rip.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll go to will the the
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you there Andy?
[SPEAKER_02]: I Can't hear him.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought that was me this whole time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah I was waiting for And the Nordics we just enjoyed I loved it I
[SPEAKER_04]: My goodness I was talking and you guys were like I couldn't hear you I went to hit them and then it just kicked me out made me let take a lap.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, okay what I was gonna say is AI is Everywhere and it's low relatively low cost and everyone is using it the same way to create to either
[SPEAKER_04]: create content, refine content, repurpose content, or format it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So any one of those editing functions, AI can do, and it can do exceptionally well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And everyone is using it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the question isn't that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the more and more you do it, the more and more everyone else is doing it, the more content will become everywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: My point is, it has to be targeted towards something for some particular goal.
[SPEAKER_04]: I use it to promote
[SPEAKER_04]: Personal brand you can use it to promote your company to do your build whatever and then as I promote my personal brand I'm telling people I've done it for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can do it for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it and then Then you know a little deeper who needs a personal brand to me it's
[SPEAKER_04]: Companies who have leadership who don't have one who have average to low personal brand on their leadership and average to low personal brand on their company because their company needs a better brand and If you increase the leadership personal brands of each company the company valuation goes up 10 to 40 percent on average according to McKinsey and Gartner and Forbes and blah blah blah blah blah
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the goal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I make a company that's, let's say, have a $10 million valuation today, can I make it worth $11 million simply by creating personal brands for each one of the leadership using these content tools?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the whole thing, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's cool to have a
[SPEAKER_04]: To use a dumb example, it's cool to be able to walk, and then it's cool to be able to build a bicycle that you can push, and then it's cool to be able to bicycle that you can pedal, and then it's cool to build a bicycle you can put an engine on, but so what?
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you need a bicycle for?
[SPEAKER_04]: And what I've done is say, who needs a personal brand, how can it benefit someone, and how can it benefit someone with real, tangible, monetary results?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've found that for me, that's the answer.
[SPEAKER_04]: It also matches me, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm older.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've done 35 years of consulting.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been in the corporate world.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been in the project world.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've changed massive organizations.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've worked with executives in the C-suite for decades.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is a direct fit for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope it works for everybody else, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: But for me, this is it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm reaching out to executives.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I have them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have one proposal that this weekend I met, and they said, OK, we've got this company.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are two founders.
[SPEAKER_04]: We do this amount of work.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're doing this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I said, OK, here's your assessment.
[SPEAKER_04]: Boom, out of 100, you scored 21.
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously, there's a lot of work to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can add channels.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can do this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And by the way, these content systems,
[SPEAKER_04]: This is, these content generation systems are the same kind of exploding capability and exploding model as an AI answering machine for a phone.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a direct correlation to a dollar, bottom line dollar increase.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you can do that, which is what, that's what I'm doing, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, there's what I just said.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no filter.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no nothing hidden.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is exactly what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I am reaching out to executives that I know and executives that I don't know and saying your company valuation can grow if you do this thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've done an assessment of your stuff and you guys are only doing this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you just did this other thing, you'll probably see increased customer retention, increased customer trust, increased valuation, including directly to your stock valuation.
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's a good solution there, Andy.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would say and I do something similar on the paid ads side where I do audits.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I do an audit.
[SPEAKER_05]: And even what I would encourage you to do is test between calling it an audit
[SPEAKER_05]: versus calling it an assessment.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you may find out, you know, doing the A-B split test that there's more interest in an audit and you're getting more calls booked using the term audit versus an assessment.
[SPEAKER_05]: So something for you to think about.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, when I do something similar on their marketing,
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, and they're, you know, paid ads if they're running paid ads, right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I do an audit.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I take a look at how much money they're spending right now and what their current revenue is.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I take a look at the ads and the analytics and I'm like, Oh yeah, like, you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: your audience targeting is off here or hey you know what your creative is off or your copy or this isn't compelling enough offer or fill in the blank right so I do this audit and then I give that to him and of course I use AI to help do the assessment and then I give them the the results and then they they say
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah, how can I work with you to improve this?
[SPEAKER_05]: Right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because they all everyone, every business wants to improve, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: They want to be in business if they don't want to improve, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's just a natural progression.
[SPEAKER_05]: So but yeah, it's like, you know, they need a content system.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they need marketing and paid ads.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like, what else do businesses need for these AI solutions?
[SPEAKER_05]: But start with the business problem first.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't just say, OK, I have this shiny new object AI.
[SPEAKER_05]: I need to plug it into a business.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not the approach.
[SPEAKER_05]: The approach is assess their business and see what they're currently doing as far as their operations go and see, well, yeah, a voice AI receptionist would be good for you guys, and here's why.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go about it that way.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't just think of like, oh, I got to plug in AI here.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that's not the way to do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Focus on assessing what their current operations is like, and then see how you can enhance and streamline things.
[SPEAKER_05]: Look, Amazon and Target are laying off tons of people.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone's got to build their own thing now.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's forced entrepreneurship.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've been talking about it for over a year.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, that that's the reality.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you got to build your own thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It starts with your personal brand.
[SPEAKER_05]: It starts with your personal brand.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything starts with personal brands.
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's check in with will real quickly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause I know he's been waiting here and, uh, and yeah, we'll, are you hosting a space today?
[SPEAKER_00]: I am indeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I'm glad I could hear you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to take two laps before I could hear anybody speaking today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully, Axe is going to play ball for the space later.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yes, in about two and a quarter hours, we've got another episode of The Internal Game.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been recording literally all day, so I hope my voice comes back in time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I wanted to jump in with the pricing strategy, because as you guys know, I launched the new prices yesterday.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really interesting to see what's happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a few teething problems, but everything's settled.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everything seems to be landing pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I wanted to check in and tell you guys kind of how it worked live.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for anyone who's on school, I know Andy has a community as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The team there basically allowed you to monetize in any model now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Homozy came in and said that all of the money model stuff in his book is now available through school.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can do anything on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the limit is 10,000 a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're above that, maybe not for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, the pricing was really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've got a follow on from yesterday where we talked about how I went from pricing in dollars to pricing in pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Trish actually messaged me with the current conversion rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it actually outpaced where I thought I would be on my next price increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was wild because I had managed to, I was charging about $3,300 now, as opposed to $2,500.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I made that switch by going from dollars to pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I kind of missed that mental barrier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been just telling people, this is what my prices are now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the next one is 4K for four months.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's actually quite interesting how that little psychological trick managed to get me over that boundary.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've been thinking long and hard about what Andy said the other day about providing those higher level outcomes that I know I can provide to people who need them more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, because yeah, like, like we always say, success without fulfillment is the ultimate failure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got the success, but you don't feel fulfilled, that's the new niche now that I'm doubling down on, because that's where I can really bring the biggest quality of life upgrade to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, that's my little update.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking forward to seeing everyone for another episode of The Internal Game.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see we've got Avni in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really excited to see what we dig into today.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, Justin, back to you, mate.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, good stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, thanks for the update.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, like, congrats on, you know, the great progress.
[SPEAKER_05]: And thanks for the update.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's exciting, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's exciting.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, so there's a direct correlation with
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, Will, correct me if I'm wrong, but like, because you're doing daily, daily stuff, the engagement is like really high with those people that are super engaged.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a direct correlation when you have that stickiness within the community, especially the school community, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: You can actually, there's a direct correlation to an increase in not only engagement, but revenue, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because here, here's, here's how that looks.
[SPEAKER_05]: In the past, before school communities, when I would build Facebook groups, so this is before Facebook ads even existed, okay?
[SPEAKER_05]: I built fan pages to over 100,000 for speakers, authors, and coaches with zero ad budget, because ads weren't even available in Facebook, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: We're talking back to like 2010 days.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so what I realized was that when I built these group pages,
[SPEAKER_05]: And we engaged with the communities and the members.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they showed up to live events.
[SPEAKER_05]: Guess what?
[SPEAKER_05]: They spent more money.
[SPEAKER_05]: Why?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because we had actually pre engaged with them.
[SPEAKER_05]: We built relationships and rapport with them before a live event.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that just translated even more engagement, more excitement, more joy, more fulfillment.
[SPEAKER_05]: in the in-person events, and then they would sign up and say, wow, yeah, I want to, I want to, you know, I need more coaching.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to get more coaching.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the same thing is playing out for Will right now in the school community, because it's so engaged, it's daily, and then there's a direct correlation to revenue.
[SPEAKER_05]: So go ahead and speak to that for a second.
[SPEAKER_05]: Will, correct me if I'm wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the beautiful thing about this, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because what we do, like the promise of my community is so simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody goes more than 24 hours without state recalibration.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the whole promise, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not aware, state recalibration is your internal state of being.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if somebody is in a reactive mode,
[SPEAKER_00]: Like in business, let's say you get rejected by a client and you're in a reactive mode and you spiral.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't just lose that moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You lose the day thinking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You lose the two weeks of momentum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And your business can suffer very noticeable revenue drops because you and an internal state, because as we always say, the operator is the bottleneck of the operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So daily state recalibration means that I take those dips, I take those two to three to four week spirals and I shorten them to 24 hours so that nobody's more than 24 hours without calibration.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it's so impactful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got business owner in there who have
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, because we don't control the circumstances.
[SPEAKER_00]: People can have rejections.
[SPEAKER_00]: People can have things not go right in their business.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if they've got a place to come back to daily and check in and be like, OK, I know that I feel rubbish now, but 30 minutes in this call, I'm going to feel on top of the world again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go out and I'm going to smash it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the promise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it actually works better every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my primary goal with the community is how do I get people in this community every single day?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've got a text thing, which I know you've seen occasionally, Justin.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a daily video call.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my thought process here is if I can help these people succeed, then I can ascend them up the tier ladder, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I want people who have no money because it's free to join.
[SPEAKER_00]: to be so well calibrated that they can go out and start a business and earn money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they can join on the $99 tier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there we go even deeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now they can get to 10,000 a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they can join at the $500 tier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a virtuous cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the goal of the community, as far as I'm concerned, has not changed from day one, which is daily state calibration for entrepreneurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did lose my way a little bit trying to make it for everybody, but I got my ass kicked by my members.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for those of you in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they reminded me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like my job is to hold that, hold that standard and not let it slip.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now that people have the consistency, cause I'm going to, I'm there every single day, migraine or whatever, it's not going to stop me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got something they can rely on to bring them back into their state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why it's so engaged.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it's taking off in the way it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: I gotta applaud your commitment, Will, and your dedication to the craft.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's the true way right there is a dedication and commitment to the craft towards mastery.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can tell when someone is in full alignment and in full
[SPEAKER_05]: Purpose driven like will is like these are the types of results you have, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just the results are a byproduct of the commitment and the dedication to the craft, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: That that's what it's all about.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is how you become a high performer.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is clearly how you become a high performer.
[SPEAKER_05]: So everything starts with commitment.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I've said that before.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, and, and I couldn't agree and I couldn't state it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't say it enough.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it all starts with commitment.
[SPEAKER_05]: So great, great stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, great update, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: And thanks for, thanks for sharing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, yeah, really, you know, we've been on this journey together for over a year and, and to see how far you've come in, in building this out and the dedication to the craft, it doesn't go unnoticed.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just want to applaud you for that because yeah, I mean, I've, I've been right alongside you, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: So and I wish I can contribute more to the school community, the daily stuff, but you know, I gotta.
[SPEAKER_05]: As I've said, you know, I prioritize revenue and client fulfillment over anything else.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's just the way I am right now, because, you know, I don't have the luxury of, you know, being in a different financial position yet, but I will be there.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can you can almost guarantee that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you, Will.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just jump in to say that I tell this to people in the community, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The winning condition is that you are too busy winning to be here to calibrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the only win condition I accept.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're out there too busy winning to be here calibrating.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I love it, Justin.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, thanks so much will for tapping in here.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to go for another 10 minutes here guys and then I'll sign us off here.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, let's go over to.
[SPEAKER_05]: DMP wealth and then we'll go to Patricia and yeah Just keep it to like a minute or two max if you can guys would really appreciate it And then we're gonna start winding down but shout out to you know, everyone down below who's listening?
[SPEAKER_05]: We got lazy Canadian Jim out there You know good good to see you Jim.
[SPEAKER_05]: I I consider you a mentor Jim So whether you like it or not, but you know, I consider you a model of success So thank you Jim for being here always great to see you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hope your Wednesday is going well and
[SPEAKER_05]: Antonio, good to see you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jodell, guys, make sure you subscribe to Jodell's pre-launch for her book, Run It Like You Own It.
[SPEAKER_05]: Make sure you guys subscribe.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just subscribed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully I was already subscribed.
[SPEAKER_05]: If I wasn't, I am now.
[SPEAKER_05]: So good to see you, Jodell.
[SPEAKER_05]: Always a pleasure to see you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Avni is here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Avni is a co-host and just a wonderful person.
[SPEAKER_05]: great voice like Will.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the two of them, it's like you're getting the two best voices on X together in a space.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're always in for a treat.
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you, Avni.

[SPEAKER_05]: Johnny, XPhoenix is here as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw your message, XPhoenix.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll try to answer it after the space on the replies.
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you so much for being here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll just give you an indicator of positioning.
[SPEAKER_05]: So positioning is everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: And how you position your personal brand is, and I've gotten coaching on this myself, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: I had to get some coaching.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, look into positioning, use your LLM of choice and just try to come up with, you know, based on who I am, what I do, what I believe in, my core values, what's a good positioning statement for me and my personal brand and start there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Steven, good to see you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Happy Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_05]: Stephen is just an ex-legend here and a wealth of knowledge and just a great guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: So thanks, Stephen, for being here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good to see you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hope your Wednesday is going well.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, let's jump over to DMP Wealth.
[SPEAKER_05]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much, Justin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, you guys have been opening my eyes to so many things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I actually came up here because I have a question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So someone was actually talking on the use of AI
[SPEAKER_01]: a while ago so that's actually got me to want to ask this question so is there a way as a as a as a builder or someone building a brand of course is there a way that one will use AI becomes too much like becomes too much in the sense that probably maybe let me take for instance using AI to
[SPEAKER_01]: to create content, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We think content, you know, for your target audience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, is there a way you probably use AI and algorithms on platforms like LinkedIn X will actually notice that, okay, these contents, even though they are rich, they are rich contents, and because it is AI, they will kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: probably, I don't know, ban it or set it in a way that it doesn't get to reach the people it's supposed to reach.
[SPEAKER_01]: So is there a way, is it possible to use AI and it's too much?
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, that's my question.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, great question.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll just say,
[SPEAKER_05]: how we stand out from AI is the human element, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we're emotional creatures, you know, you continuously need to humanize your brand.
[SPEAKER_05]: And just, you know, AI is just an accelerator of, you know, creating content like the systems we've been talking about here.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't think there's necessarily an opportunity for too much.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, they could decide the algorithm gods could decide, hey, we're gonna D boost
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not going to boost AI content as much as non-AI generated content.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, who knows, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: But the fundamentals of content creation is frequency, is quantity, quality, and how engaging your content is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did we just lose Justin?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my God, I think I lost him.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think we did.
[SPEAKER_04]: Justin, we're okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: We did lose him.
[SPEAKER_06]: We did lose him.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're also going over time, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're 10 minutes over.
[SPEAKER_04]: Justin, you back?
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go to Will and then let's go to Patricia.
[SPEAKER_04]: Patricia's had her hand up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go to Patricia real quick.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, Patricia.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, Andy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, Christelle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, Justin, even though we can't hear you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to laugh because when Will was talking, the fact that I was able to point out that going from $2,500 to 2,500 pounds, that it's amazing that shift with just that little currency symbol and makes it easier to maybe get over that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've done that every day.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had to do that calculation in my head for so long.
[SPEAKER_03]: For me, that felt like nothing, but I love knowing that I was able to help you with that, Will.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, he's talking about putting a drill socket and getting his butt kicked on the call last night.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wasn't the one kicking his butt, but I was there for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, it was,
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think last night was really good for him and good for all of us.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you're in your, when you're in his group, he says he doesn't want you to go 24 hours without recalibrating.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's true.
[SPEAKER_03]: He gives you the opportunity.
[SPEAKER_03]: He doesn't force you to do it, but you always have that opportunity.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what I love about his community is that there's always somebody there ready to jump in and see you and reinforce you with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I,
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, things are going well, and he's hitting quite a groove for himself here, so.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, thanks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks, Patricia.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully you can hear me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we can.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, okay, great, great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, thanks for the share.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll let Will respond here and do his final word, and then we're going to wrap up here, guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Lost track of time, but yeah, Will, over to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you a real short, I was gonna say thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was really good to get such direct feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a military person, that's exactly how I need to hear things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was gonna reply to DMP Wealthy about AI.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what I said when somebody asked me previously, and I wrote it down because it's really succinct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good when it thinks with you, bad when it thinks for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can,
[SPEAKER_00]: If you pump out AI-generated content, and it gets results, and the algorithm starts to take note, you didn't actually learn what got the results.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just copy-paste.
[SPEAKER_00]: So learn what makes the content good, and use the AI to think with you, but not for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I would say from experience on that one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks, Will.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, great, great, great tips.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love that one.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll have to clip that one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just, it's, it's really an accelerant of, you know, who you are, what you do.
[SPEAKER_05]: And look, if somebody asked me if I offline, if I use AI, I was like, well, do you breathe?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like air.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: At this point, like, I mean, of course I use AI, like who wouldn't.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the people who don't like, they're just going to get left in the dust.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that's just the honest to God truth.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, you just need it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, AI is not going to take your job.
[SPEAKER_05]: Someone that uses AI better than you is going to take your job.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So you just better, you know, build your own thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, all right, we're going to do final word here.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll go to Timo and then Christelle and then Andy.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, just keep it to like a minute if you can guys, but thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Another great space here.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, all right, go for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: Great space again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately missed the very beginning.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for XPhoenix, I'm looking for that prompt.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to drop it in the comment section so you can test it and see the results.
[SPEAKER_02]: DM me about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We should have DM connections.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, build those routines.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely, I'm enjoying a lot what I'm currently doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm basically...
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm basically one week ahead with my content schedule.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty much the only thing I do is I go and be in Beehive, we get the ads on a weekly basis on Sunday.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll just usually go and flip those and then I'll do a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit of nurturing and whatnot it may be.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have been kind of off from the social media, the algo platforms.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're kind of giving me a bit of anxiety at the moment, but it's getting better actually seeing my ex posts go somewhere again at least for a bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's been a very busy couple of weeks at work, so I haven't been able to do much of posting, even during the lunch hour or whatnot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, I'm coming back.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm crawling back.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's dark and cold here in the north, but it's time to dig in and start posting again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, great space, and I'll land my plane here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, thanks, Timo.
[SPEAKER_05]: Always a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for tapping in, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: We missed you.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, keep crushing it, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, let's go over to... Yeah, dude, I've been logging into like, hey, Justice Space, and taking the dog out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'm like, oh, there's a recording.
[SPEAKER_02]: What the hell?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it's like, ah, the damn time.
[SPEAKER_02]: get friends changed.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, anyways, let's go to the next one.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, go ahead, Christelle, and then we'll go to Andy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks, Teemo.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm over here talking to Ani because she's making like $10 a newsletter now because she's up to three ads.
[SPEAKER_06]: She's doing so good.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm so proud of her.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so nice when you, you know, when the student outshines just everybody, like she's such a top.
[SPEAKER_06]: Her and Kevin, they're so amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: So now I'm, I'm trying to catch up to them and I'm excited about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm so inspired, you know, to get back into the newsletter again, like for real, for real.
[SPEAKER_06]: So and thank you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'm gonna look into school Because yeah, I don't know every time you talk about it and grace is talking about it multiple people So I want to look into that and if you miss Justin's content system and Andy's content system They both described it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was so good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Go back and listen to the replay and
[SPEAKER_06]: I took a little bit of notes for Justin's and put it up in the Jumbotron.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hope that's cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Make sure you all look through the Jumbotron.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you subscribe to the newsletter, check out his new AI.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, just listen, I love Justin not on the job, you know, because he is just so creative.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's in building mode.
[SPEAKER_06]: He doesn't play no games.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's spicy like is good stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I understand we all understand, you know, we go in and out.
[SPEAKER_06]: So.
[SPEAKER_06]: Much love can't wait for tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_06]: Have a wonderful rest of your day.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, thank you Yeah, thank you Cristal for the kind words.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Justin not in job mode is like another It's the Ronin unfiltered, you know, it's like Andy Andy unfiltered, you know, so yeah, it's just for me It's like, you know not having that control over me, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: I can share another story another day when we have more time, but I
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I moved out at 18.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, I'm out of here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I can't, I can't, I can't, I'm out of here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I cannot, you know, 18, I was out of the house.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, you know, don't, don't, you can't control me.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't hold on to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I'm out of here.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, that's just my, that's why the Ronin that that's it resonates with me so much because ultimately.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's who I am.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's my brand.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, thank you, Christelle, for the kind words.
[SPEAKER_05]: Always a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, it was definitely a great space today.
[SPEAKER_05]: And thanks, everyone, for joining.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Andy, final word over to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, everything we do needs to have a purpose.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're just doing stuff as an experiment, that's fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you don't have a purpose, eventually you'll stop doing everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so high performance
[SPEAKER_04]: routines, my high-performance routine is finding out what people want, finding out what benefits them, and then figuring out a way to give it to them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is my primary function, is to find out what can benefit other people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I read a Zig Ziglar book way back a million years ago, and he basically said, you can have anything you want if you help other people get what they want.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think I read that book when I was 17 or 18 years old.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how old it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: And since that time, that, that methodology and that primary function of my professional and personal life has benefited me in millions and millions of dollars.
[SPEAKER_04]: So thanks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Appreciate the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a great day.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: What a great book.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Zig Ziglar.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Legend.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, I'll just say purpose, passion, profit, purpose, passion, profit.
[SPEAKER_05]: And once that's in full alignment, you're unstoppable, right?
