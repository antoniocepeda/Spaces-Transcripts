[SPEAKER_08]: All right, well, good morning, my friends.
[SPEAKER_08]: Good morning, my friends, my ex friends, my ex crew.
[SPEAKER_08]: Good to see you, Andy, Joe Dell.
[SPEAKER_08]: Good to see you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Loving seeing your stuff on LinkedIn for the for the book.
[SPEAKER_08]: Good morning, Danielle.
[SPEAKER_08]: Good to see you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hope you're doing well.
[SPEAKER_08]: I. I mentioned something on a post yesterday.
[SPEAKER_08]: For for you, Daniel, I don't remember what it was, though, but but, yeah, so, oh, Newport Beach.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I was like, hey, you know, you mentioned, yeah, it's nice when you can walk around Newport Beach.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, yeah, man, especially I get over to the wedge for me and go, go walk over there by the jetty and check out the wedge for me.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's my spot over there.
[SPEAKER_08]: So great to have you here, Daniel Jodell.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, cheesy 25 and.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hopefully, Andy will come back here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, there's Andy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, yeah, guys, um, it's.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thursday here, um, and we're working from home today.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, uh, my client engagement is Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and then Thursday, Friday is, you know, my other stuff and other client work and.
[SPEAKER_08]: Got to close one more deal, ideally a biotech startup for a fractional CMO advisory and some execution.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that'll be great.
[SPEAKER_08]: So just working on outreach, prospecting, and yeah, that's what my focus is.
[SPEAKER_08]: Also getting my Halloween costume ready.
[SPEAKER_08]: You already know what it is.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the Revenue Ronin costume.
[SPEAKER_08]: So getting that ready.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hopefully I can still fit into it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, because I'm not as late as I was last year this time.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, uh, but yeah, great to have you guys aboard here.
[SPEAKER_08]: for another revenue-running community space.
[SPEAKER_08]: How do you stay relevant after rejections is going to be the topic, but before we get into that, please like and repost the space.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, Jodell, you'll love this one.
[SPEAKER_08]: Our sponsor for today's space is Play, and I highly encourage you to check out this link.
[SPEAKER_08]: to the page where you can actually see a link to the AI Ads powered platform.
[SPEAKER_08]: I do a quick demo walkthrough video and share more about it, and so definitely check it out.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're doing your book launch, you'll definitely want to use this tool.
[SPEAKER_08]: Instead of running ads on Google or Facebook or whatever,
[SPEAKER_08]: You integrate it with your Google Facebook account, but then you run it through the ad AI ads platform and the results are much, much better, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll get lower cost.
[SPEAKER_08]: ideally better quality traffic and leads, and ultimately, ideally, sales.
[SPEAKER_08]: But at the very least, I think a good strategy for you is to give away a lead magnet, a free chapter of the book.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then get their email address and then over time, like, remark it to them again and say, hey, did you like the 1st chapter?
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll love the whole book.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, here it is for a limited time off or something like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's the that's the progression.
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, people will buy the book right away, but.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, majority of people you gotta warm up, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: You gotta warm up, so definitely check it out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Jodell let me know if you have any questions and yeah, let's go over to it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Please like and repost the space guys and this is a sponsored space by play which is an AI ads powered platform that I just mentioned and you can check out the link to the landing page that I built out for this specifically and.
[SPEAKER_08]: I use card for that so.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, and yeah, let's jump over to Andy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Andy, good morning.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, good morning.
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, how do you stay relevant after rejection?
[SPEAKER_10]: You're assuming something here.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, uh, my family were educators, including my mother who was an English teacher.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, logic in English and language were very important for me my whole life.
[SPEAKER_10]: They still are.
[SPEAKER_10]: This assumes that if you're rejected, you're not relevant.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's not true.
[SPEAKER_10]: Rejection means their circumstances don't align with what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_10]: Not necessarily that you have any difference or change.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's kind of like if you're the rock on the side of the beach and the waves smash you, the rock doesn't change.
[SPEAKER_10]: It might get a little smoother and might rough edges be roughed off, but it's still a rock.
[SPEAKER_10]: And no matter how far and how many, and how often the waves smash against you, the rock is still the rock.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's still relevant at all times.
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you put yourself out there emotionally,
[SPEAKER_10]: The only difference between this, and by the way, thank you all of you who were on the Ronin extra call, because you made me realize this.
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's my realization.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't change.
[SPEAKER_10]: And the only reason that I get any type of insecurity or feeling is because I have an expectation that something would happen.
[SPEAKER_10]: Instead, if I lift weights, I expect to be able to push the weight all the way up until I can't, and at some point I don't.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, that's the way it goes.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's my expectation.
[SPEAKER_10]: If my expectation is I can't push the weight up at all and I can, I think, woohoo, it has exceeded my expectation.
[SPEAKER_10]: If I push the weight up and I can't push it up,
[SPEAKER_10]: I get frustrated because my expectation was I was able to.
[SPEAKER_10]: The difference between expectation and reality is what we call rejection or insecurity or results.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then how we interpret it is whether we feel rejected or insecure or whatever.
[SPEAKER_10]: And all it is, is if you take an action, something happens, that's the result.
[SPEAKER_10]: End of story.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not good or bad.
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't help or hurt.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just the result.
[SPEAKER_10]: How you interpret it is your expectation.
[SPEAKER_10]: Your expectation of rejection and staying relevant assumes that those are important.
[SPEAKER_10]: But maybe they're not.
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe you're always relevant.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you're always rejected, and neither one of those things matter to each other.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, well, thank you, Andy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Wise words.
[SPEAKER_08]: What you shared really resonated with me and I should have separated out the two words because I ran out of space.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I tried to do two topics in one, which is is so I'll maybe have to rename the space.
[SPEAKER_08]: But where I was leaning towards was, you know, how do you stay relevant?
[SPEAKER_08]: as one topic and then, you know, how do you continue after, you know, rejections when it comes to a lot of prospects rejecting you?
[SPEAKER_08]: So, so that, that's the full.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, the, the, the answer is simple.
[SPEAKER_10]: The answer is expect a lot of rejection.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then when you get somebody who says acceptance, it's a surprise and delight.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you expect.
[SPEAKER_10]: a hundred rejections and you only get 97 and three people say okay well then now you've you've pivoted the mindset of what do I expect and what do I get what am I expecting to get.
[SPEAKER_10]: By the way I expect to do my workout and get hot sweaty and exhausted after every single one of them but you know what happens if you do them enough times
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't get warmed up.
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't get sweaty and you don't move to kind of a point of muscular failure because your body adapts and you can do the hundred pushups and you're like not breathing and you can still talk to people.
[SPEAKER_10]: So you have to start making it more difficult.
[SPEAKER_10]: My point is whatever your expectation is determines
[SPEAKER_10]: your feeling of relevance or your feeling of rejection.
[SPEAKER_10]: And feelings are notoriously inaccurate and they can be manipulated extremely easily.
[SPEAKER_10]: So just work on the facts and the things that you can control, which is, did you do the hundred calls?
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you do the hundred pushups or not?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, well said.
[SPEAKER_08]: And yeah, truth truth be told about today.
[SPEAKER_08]: I would be in the gym, but I have a migraine, so I took some Excedrin and hanging out in my.
[SPEAKER_08]: Office garage here so.
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, I mean, I agree with everything you said.
[SPEAKER_08]: Managing expectations is a big part of it and.
[SPEAKER_08]: you know part of and this was one of the core values of a company I used to work at was you know you got to be ready to face rejection a thousand times and embrace it and yeah I mean that that's the reality in business is you know you're going to get rejected you know your your startup ideas are going to get rejected your pitches are going to be rejected your proposal is going to be rejected and that's part of the journey right and if you're not okay with that
[SPEAKER_08]: Then you know you're going to have a challenge, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I embrace it.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, my mindset is look, it's going to take me 100100 nose to get to one.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right, so so just keep going through those nose and then you'll get that one.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, it is my approach so.
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, let's go over to Danielle and welcome Karata, Antonio.
[SPEAKER_08]: Good to see you guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hope you're doing well.
[SPEAKER_08]: Happy Thursday.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we also have Beach Life and Musa Weir.
[SPEAKER_08]: Great to have you guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: And Chizzy, good to see you guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, let's go over to Danielle.
[SPEAKER_08]: Danielle, good morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Happy Thursday.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big, big shout out to Ms. Jodell and her book being published.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, let's make some noise.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, can I touch this wand?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I?
[SPEAKER_02]: Here you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I touched the wand.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not in my space.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Jodell ordered your book yesterday.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got it, girl.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will be here tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Karata had, you know, read your book, your ebook, when I first met you several months ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, come on, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are doing it, okay?
[SPEAKER_02]: We are doing it here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, rejection, irrelevance.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, here's the truth, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're not getting rejected, nobody wants to.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you're not getting rejected, that just means you're playing it too damn safe.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're playing it too small.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rejection is part of the process.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, rejection is kind of like failure, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: We think that this is big, bad and ugly stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is not.
[SPEAKER_02]: All this is is intel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when, when Andy, I love how, you know, you're, you're talking about the rejection and the relevance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to me, like rejection isn't the end of being relevant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, okay, what do I got to do?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's the beginning of reinvention.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And can rejection hurt your feelings?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: But if we stop feeling, then that's where we become irrelevant.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where we start to stay high.
[SPEAKER_02]: So instead of being like, you know, bitter about something, I'm like, I got to stay curious.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll put a WTF.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like,
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, to know WTF watch the feedback
[SPEAKER_02]: Every no is not an end.
[SPEAKER_02]: All it is is information.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we are not going to be for everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our product or service or whatever we're delivering is not going to be for everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I categorically try to do, and we'll call it rejection.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, the no is a rejection.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this service or product even useful or wanted by this person?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not so much a reflection of me or what I'm doing all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes it'll be, but sometimes it's because it's not just for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I try to categorically look at like,
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, that didn't land.
[SPEAKER_02]: But why?
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe they don't need that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, let's say I was selling vacuums and they already have four.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not about how lousy my vacuum is.
[SPEAKER_02]: They own four.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, you have to look at things from, I think, a bigger a bigger picture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think that.
[SPEAKER_02]: To stay relevant, you can't avoid rejection, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: The difference is how you respond to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything's about responding and not reacting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the people that do well, what I try to do is I treat those rejections like a strategy session.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I look at it and I go, OK, this isn't a setback.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is more of like we always talk about it, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a setback so much as it's a setup.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a breakdown so much as a breakthrough, all those things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And every no to me, that's just Intel, every closed door.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just a pivot point.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know how this girl loves her pivots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, the market, the people, the community out there, they're not going to forget the ones who evolve.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to forget the ones who retreat.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I choose not to retreat.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that's the difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's how you stay relevant after rejection.
[SPEAKER_08]: I love that Danielle.
[SPEAKER_08]: Rejection is just redirection, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: And.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I couldn't agree more with everything you said.
[SPEAKER_08]: And yeah, it's just getting that feedback.
[SPEAKER_08]: And look, it's not, your stuff is not for everyone.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's why I always say like the 3% rule, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Like 3% of people are ready to buy right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the other 97% of people are just not ready, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: So I documented that down and I put Jodell's book up there for you guys, a link to her website.
[SPEAKER_08]: So definitely check it out, run it like you own it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, uh, and yeah, um, love, love the opening opening words, Danielle.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, uh, and yeah, let's check in with, uh, beach life info, uh, beach life info.
[SPEAKER_08]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_12]: Justin.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_12]: And Andy Abel, uh, yep.
[SPEAKER_12]: Justin and Andy, thank you for the space.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for having me up.
[SPEAKER_12]: I just wanted to throw something at you first off, but just a mic check.
[SPEAKER_12]: Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, you're good, yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_12]: What I do, for example, or what other team members do is that we consider sometimes what we offer, the customer know they need it, but sometimes they have their own problems that makes it restrictive for them.
[SPEAKER_12]: So we try to see things from their side.
[SPEAKER_12]: And what we do is we offer what we call a soft carrot.
[SPEAKER_12]: What a soft carrot is, for example, like we, we provide a service that that's retirement, but when you get older, so we have a relationship on a number of pillow and bedding companies, and we offer a coupon and it's an introductory really to our product, but what it is, it's a, you know, like spend time and hear what's good for your back and get a free pillow.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it always opens the door.
[SPEAKER_12]: You see, sometimes you just have to find something that helps you start the conversation, because in reality, we approach things this way.
[SPEAKER_12]: People don't want to talk to you.
[SPEAKER_12]: People don't want you to tell them what they need, because as far as they're concerned, their life is upside down.
[SPEAKER_12]: It doesn't matter how much money they have.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's never enough.
[SPEAKER_12]: It doesn't matter how much time they need.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's never enough.
[SPEAKER_12]: So, you know, the way we approach it is that we approach that the customer never has enough of what they want or what they need.
[SPEAKER_12]: So how can we approach them with an understanding that.
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's give them something to start the conversation that says here, this is, this is something it's a, it's a gift that leads to a result that leads to a solution for something that you need.
[SPEAKER_12]: I know you probably can't afford it now, but here's how we're going to get you there.
[SPEAKER_12]: And by the way, you need good pillows or you need a good mattress.
[SPEAKER_12]: Somebody always needs a good pillow or a good mattress.
[SPEAKER_12]: Trust me.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, you know, don't want to take up too much of your time.
[SPEAKER_12]: I hope that helps.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I hope you understand where I'm going with this.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you again for the mic, you guys and ladies.
[SPEAKER_12]: Have a great day.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Great, great insights.
[SPEAKER_08]: Love the share.
[SPEAKER_08]: And yeah, I put down that, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: Typically, people don't buy for a couple of reasons.
[SPEAKER_08]: Number one, they don't have the budget.
[SPEAKER_08]: Number two, they don't have a need.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't need a refrigerator.
[SPEAKER_08]: Even if one's on sale, I don't need it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Mine's functioning properly.
[SPEAKER_08]: But when my refrigerator goes out,
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I need a refrigerator, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: So, um, you know, no, no budget, no need, or it's not aligned with them.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, and I will say, too, is, and this applies to, you know, retirement planning and stuff like that as well as.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, you need to make sure you're talking to all the decision makers on the call.
[SPEAKER_08]: At 1 time, because what can tend to happen sometimes is if your proposals large enough, or, um.
[SPEAKER_08]: you know.
[SPEAKER_08]: A countrywide company wide initiative.
[SPEAKER_08]: You need to get buy in from other departments.
[SPEAKER_08]: Other senior executives, for example.
[SPEAKER_08]: They all need to sign off, so you know, just making sure you're getting all the right people on the call at the same time and really getting that buy in and you create what's called champions.
[SPEAKER_08]: Internal champions that can help you accomplish that so.
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, go ahead Beach life.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_12]: Just to touch on that though, and again, coming from personal experience and also team member experience, you can't always, sometimes you just need that one air to take you to where you need to get to.
[SPEAKER_12]: Because what we, again, what we consider and what we look at is that the customer or the individual does not need us.
[SPEAKER_12]: nor do they need our service.
[SPEAKER_12]: We think they do.
[SPEAKER_12]: They, for whatever reason, don't because they would have had it already.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like for example, you need food, you need shelter.
[SPEAKER_12]: Everything else in your mind is secondary.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, everybody needs a vacation.
[SPEAKER_12]: Does everybody get one?
[SPEAKER_12]: No.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, so I'm just saying like sometimes, and this is only an opinion, sometimes we approach things
[SPEAKER_12]: when we offer a product or service in such a way that it says, you know, if you don't get this, something's wrong with you.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we don't do that.
[SPEAKER_12]: We, we approach it saying, you know what, you have everything you need, but just in case along the path of life, you're going to get old and you may not have thought of everything.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I just need your one ear.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I know you may have a spouse or you may have other members in your organization that need to hear this.
[SPEAKER_12]: But let's start with you, and I hope you can guide me to the other members that help you make a decision.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, sometimes you just need a starting point.
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, I'll shut up.
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry about that, Justin.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'll really mute and stay quiet this time.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, no, no, no need to apologize.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, your shares have been great, and yeah, contributing to the conversation, which is always good.
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, I mean,
[SPEAKER_08]: Retirement is a big, uh, is a big deal and, um.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I, I think, you know, it's, it's definitely a good reminder for all of us that, you know, as we approach those.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, later years, you know, what are we doing to prepare for that?
[SPEAKER_08]: And, um, and yeah, it's a big, you know, like me personally, I.
[SPEAKER_08]: I had some challenging, you know, 20s, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Which I was very prepared, you know, building things up and then, you know, life happened and I had a major setback.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, rebuilt since then, but, you know, you can't live in the past, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: You gotta live in the future.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's why I have a five-year plan right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm two years into it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so, and we shared this quote yesterday.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, I'd rather work five years, like really hard,
[SPEAKER_08]: And go hard for 5 years so that I can live the rest of my life like most people can't and that's my philosophy and I'm really leaning into that and I want to point out real quickly a quote for Andy here and for everyone here from Alex Ramosi.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, if you are under 1 million per year, you have to advertise more.
[SPEAKER_08]: No one knows you exist, which is why you're not making as much as you want.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're not fighting against competition.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're fighting against irrelevance.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is the post that I saw that kind of inspired this space in all honesty.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so there's two components here.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're talking about how do you stay relevant?
[SPEAKER_08]: And then how do you face rejections and continue moving forward?
[SPEAKER_08]: And yeah, I mean, I think the relevancy part is really important because staying relevant is a competitive advantage.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really a competitive advantage.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you're not staying relevant, right, if you're not up to date on AI, if you're not up to date, like it's a disadvantage for you.
[SPEAKER_08]: And other companies and prospects will see
[SPEAKER_08]: And I've literally had this happen this month, where people will actually reach out to you and say, wow, what are you up to, Andy?
[SPEAKER_08]: Or, man, Danielle, what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_08]: And they'll be interested and curious in what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_08]: And ideally, they'll become clients and paying customers for consultations, group coaching, your content system, whatever you have.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's just a natural progression of curiosity when they continuously see your content.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so staying relevant, you gotta continue posting.
[SPEAKER_08]: You gotta continue having conversations online, offline, and yeah, that's how you stay relevant.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's your competitive advantage.
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, anything to add here, Andy?
[SPEAKER_08]: Or Danielle?
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, Andy, where did you go?
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm here.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just, you know, sometimes my phone is on the other side of the room.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, um, your competitive advantages, you and the things that you've experienced, the things that you know, and it's difficult sometimes to quantify that.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's difficult sometimes to express that.
[SPEAKER_10]: But the truth is,
[SPEAKER_10]: Sometimes you need the reps. You need the laps.
[SPEAKER_10]: You need to have, you know, you need to have the scars.
[SPEAKER_10]: You need to have the rejection.
[SPEAKER_10]: Frankly, no horse is worth anything until it's broken.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then once it's broken, it can be useful.
[SPEAKER_10]: Same thing with men, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: A 20 year old man or a 50 year old man, which one is more reliable?
[SPEAKER_10]: Everybody knows 50 year old man.
[SPEAKER_10]: Why?
[SPEAKER_10]: Because at some point in his life, he has gone from being just a wild stallion to being a workhorse.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that you need to become that.
[SPEAKER_10]: And the only way you get that is to be broken.
[SPEAKER_10]: And the only way to get broken is to put yourself out there and be rejected and then realize and self reflect what's going on.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a normal process of life.
[SPEAKER_10]: The, uh,
[SPEAKER_10]: This idea that, well, it's an implied idea.
[SPEAKER_10]: Nobody's saying it out loud, but this implied idea of if you just do this thing and you repeat this stuff and then you'll get these results.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's not true, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: One of my rules of life is that only God, only God blesses your success and your success is only because God blessed it.
[SPEAKER_10]: And sometimes no matter what you do, you can follow exactly the recipe.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can do exactly the thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can do exactly what it is.
[SPEAKER_10]: God has a plan for your life and it's not the thing you're doing.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's something different.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so you're not going to be blessed.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's my personal opinion.
[SPEAKER_10]: You could take this however you want.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is my opinion.
[SPEAKER_10]: But on the other hand, sometimes the things that you're going to be blessed in, you screw up and it turns out good.
[SPEAKER_10]: you decide, I don't want to call that person.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then they go, man, you know, I'm so glad you didn't call yesterday.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cause I was busy, but man, I'm really ready to start today.
[SPEAKER_10]: And all of those things can be true.
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe they're true.
[SPEAKER_10]: And maybe they can be true for you too.
[SPEAKER_10]: But the point is when you are in alignment with what God wants, God,
[SPEAKER_10]: can, will, does bless you.
[SPEAKER_10]: And God will bless you in the ways that He wants to, no matter what you do.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, not to be totally Calvinistic here in my theology, because I do believe that our actions produce results as well.
[SPEAKER_10]: But if you don't do anything, you're not going to go anywhere.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you do some of the right things, they'll be easier to do and you'll get further ahead.
[SPEAKER_10]: What most people miss is the idea that I did this one thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was so easy.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't need to worry about that again.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm going to do these other things.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, they're kind of hard.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think I'll focus on all of that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Why?
[SPEAKER_10]: Why not just take the stuff that you can do easy and do it a thousand times?
[SPEAKER_10]: Because most people don't realize.
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's the reason why.
[SPEAKER_10]: Most people don't realize when you do something and it's easy for you, it's not easy for everybody else.
[SPEAKER_10]: You assume it is.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's why.
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't assume anything.
[SPEAKER_10]: You want to really change your life?
[SPEAKER_10]: You want to really take control of your life?
[SPEAKER_10]: Stop assuming anything.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's my thought.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, solid.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what those assumptions do.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, yeah, let's go over to Daniel.
[SPEAKER_08]: I saw you had your hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got you got to say it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: You remember that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't assume it makes an ass out of you and me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly how it's spelt right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We all remember that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was waiting for Andy to drop that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm over here going, no, the poor horsey broken leg.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but you know, the truth is,
[SPEAKER_02]: In these breaks, so figuratively speaking, this is where we're strengthened.
[SPEAKER_02]: We always have a choice of what we're going to do with those fallouts, with those setbacks, with those rejections.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that winners, what they do is they don't dramatize the no.
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, they don't make it bigger than it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, those things are something that we need to dissect, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's information.
[SPEAKER_02]: What can it teach me about my strategy, my audience, my timing, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So actually everything in life, okay, maybe not everything, but most things in life, this is my, this is really like my philosophy on my own life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything that's uncomfortable is useful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every single time I get uncomfortable about something, I'm like, oh, OK, that that discomfort caused me to pause.
[SPEAKER_02]: The universe has my attention because I ain't on cruise mode.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, what am I learning or what can I learn?
[SPEAKER_02]: when I stay from a place of curiosity and I check my ego, EGO.
[SPEAKER_02]: Andy's talking about God.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am all about God first and always.
[SPEAKER_02]: EGO, edging God out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to make it about me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to wear it as a bruise.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like how much are you going to self-sabotage by getting caught up on it?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really all it is is information.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes it's because you didn't put your best foot forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I've done that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then sometimes it's because I need to, you know, put a little more finesse on whatever my package is or my methodology on how I'm, you know, being of service, how I'm selling the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't believe in hiding behind failure, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, I think that when we fail, I think we need to speak about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to, you know, lead with authenticity.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you guys know that, you know, I'm the Jersey girl with transparency, you know, transparency, capital T.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, you know, flaunt it, show how you recover from it, help others rise through your own mistakes, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that's exactly how I think that we gain trust, how we gain followers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't mean just followers on Instagram on here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care so much as about the numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I care about the impact.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, just keep talking about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all about not retreating.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't mean that we're not relevant.
[SPEAKER_02]: We only become irrelevant if we, you know, go into the shadows and sit there and lick our wounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just stupid.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm here to win.
[SPEAKER_02]: And winning is going to mean that I am going to meet breaking points until I get to the next place of being stronger.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so once you accept that as the journey, right, and not the
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the ending, the obstacle.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just check your ego, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Relevance checks your endurance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rejection just checks your ego.
[SPEAKER_02]: Their ego is a waste of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really, really is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't make it about you, make it about them.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, check your ego out at the door.
[SPEAKER_08]: I love that, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I I wanted to draw everyone's attention to the purple pill.
[SPEAKER_08]: I shared a couple photos for you guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know that I think you'll you may enjoy, because it's it's an all star panel here between Andy and Danielle and myself and Joe Dell down below.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I got inspired to share some photos.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can see me and Andy in our dress blues Ronan outfits.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you can see myself, Jodell, and Danielle on a B-roll X-talk show.
[SPEAKER_08]: So there you guys have it.
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, that was another point I missed as far as why people don't buy.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, the timing part is one thing, but yeah, I mean, they just may not have a need and that's okay, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: But the follow-up, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's the importance of the follow-up.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've had this happen where I followed up with somebody that I forgot to follow up with, and then they're like, oh, I'm glad you followed up, Justin, because I really need to get going on my ad campaign or whatever, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: So the follow-up, you always want, even if it's just like,
[SPEAKER_08]: A monthly check in or quarterly check in at the very least.
[SPEAKER_08]: You want to do those follow ups because they're just quick reminders.
[SPEAKER_08]: That people need, like, people need more reminders now than not.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just it's just the reality.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, uh.
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, great stuff, Danielle.
[SPEAKER_08]: Andy, really appreciate you guys and Beach Life.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for being on stage.
[SPEAKER_08]: Please like and repost the space, guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, we're gonna go to 745 AM Pacific, so a little longer here, but it's been a great discussion so far.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hopefully you guys check out the photos that I dropped there of meeting Andy in person and Danielle and Jodell.
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanna know, when did you meet Andy?
[SPEAKER_02]: I know when you met Jodell, because I was there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when did you meet Andy?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like jealous of you meeting Andy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it was in December, I think.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it was December or January of last year, or January of this year.
[SPEAKER_08]: And yeah, I flew up there for a client meeting.
[SPEAKER_08]: And yeah, Andy met up with me and we broke bread.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: We had an amazing steak and we chatted for
[SPEAKER_08]: Just like we chat every day here for about three hours.
[SPEAKER_08]: And yeah, we did a show in his Model X Tesla.
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember Jodell was actually on that call and some others.
[SPEAKER_08]: And yeah, it was an awesome experience.
[SPEAKER_08]: And yeah, I definitely want to.
[SPEAKER_10]: We were not wearing blue dough box.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's AI added.
[SPEAKER_10]: We were wearing regular clothes, though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, dear Lord, AI is both brilliant and scary at the same time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can dress and undress people with their heads still on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if I'm loving this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love, Jodell, you might be busy, but I would love to be, you know, for you to jump on stage for a second.
[SPEAKER_02]: We love you.
[SPEAKER_02]: We support you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And certainly you've experienced some rejection even in the book writing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I mean by that is I also, as you know, and published the rejections I had in my head.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was rejecting myself when I was writing that damn thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, the internal conversations on the way to, you know, getting something as big and beautiful as that out.
[SPEAKER_02]: What a trip.
[SPEAKER_02]: What a learning journey about yourself and the growth that is in that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, the strength that is available to capture and harness, you know, but you got to go through the discomfort.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if you are available, we'd love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks very much, Danielle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thanks for buying the book.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Andy bought one too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Andy, it's on its way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I just, I actually want to flip it a little bit because I was the one, and this is so embarrassing, I can't believe I did this, but I was the one that kind of rejected the editor at one point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've never,
[SPEAKER_00]: worked with like an editor or had anyone touch my creative stuff and so when she gave it back to me for the first round of edits they had like she had em dashes in it and she had changed like some of my voice and wording and I
[SPEAKER_00]: gently accused her of using AI and I was very like specific that I didn't want it to touch the book even once and so Anyways, she teaches a class on em dashes.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's like an English teacher.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she was she wrote so well it just to me appeared like AI and so I had to
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we talked about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologized.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, it was like my knee jerk reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I read more of it, I found more of my voice and I realized it was a process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I still have some work to do on that part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can only imagine how mortified she was.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was like, I'll give you all your money back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really stuck my foot in my mouth there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, sometimes we're the person that rejects.
[SPEAKER_00]: the other person and then if we just like if I had just paused and slept on it it probably and read the rest of the edits I don't think I would have had that knee-jerk reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's interesting that you can also be on the other side of that and still experience that rejection in the opposite way.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great point.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a great point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, here's the thing, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we've become obsessed with what looks like AI.
[SPEAKER_02]: MDash is, you know, they were in the English language and writing before AI came.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's probably why AI adopted it, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And now it's all these telltale signs that we've utilized some help and, you know, we're getting so cray-cray about the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't wait till we just kind of settle down.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it was like kind of like where we yelled at 20 years ago for not going to the library and we got on our computers and we Googled something.
[SPEAKER_02]: You cheater.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, you didn't suffer enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know, I think the world is a little bit lopsided on how they're approaching this and how they're thinking people are full of BS just because they're utilizing the same damn tool we're all utilizing.
[SPEAKER_02]: The truth is, if we just sat down, if we said, okay, everybody's got three minutes to write something, and you can use chat GBT, perplexity, whatever you want, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we all came back.
[SPEAKER_02]: I gotta tell you, what I'd be writing about, what you'd be writing about, what Justin, Andy, everybody would be writing about, hello, hoops, good to see you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be all different subjects.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's just, you know, but I could see, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's such a heated thing when something as personal as a book, a book is like a baby.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I found out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or at least it's like a dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: It means a hell of a lot to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You take this stuff personal.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's like family out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I could see, but you know what you're doing, you bring up a really important point and it's the power of the pause.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about taking a second and taking emotion out of it for a heartbeat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause we need to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we talk about rejection, we need to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, it's really funny.
[SPEAKER_10]: One of the exercises that I do with my teams to help them to go from being a group of people to being a team is I said, look, communication is the most important part, but I want you all to understand I'm not a perfect communicator.
[SPEAKER_10]: Neither are you.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we all communicate differently.
[SPEAKER_10]: And here's how I'm going to prove it to you.
[SPEAKER_10]: Take out a piece of paper, or a pen, or a sketch, or your computer, or whatever you want, and draw a picture of the sun.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, and if I'm in person, it's get a piece of paper, take your pen, draw a picture of the sun.
[SPEAKER_10]: Fold it up, fold it in half.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, now, send them all forward, or give them to somebody else, or whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_10]: I said, but here's the truth.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you exchange them with everybody else, here is that this has always happened.
[SPEAKER_10]: Number one, every single drawing is different.
[SPEAKER_10]: Number two, every single person recognizes it's the sun, which means we're all talking about the same thing using a different voice and maybe a different way of explaining it, but we all understand it's the sun.
[SPEAKER_10]: So the point of the exercise is we're all going to communicate differently about the same thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: Nobody's better or worse or righter or wronger.
[SPEAKER_10]: What you have to understand is
[SPEAKER_10]: The purpose is to communicate from a piece of paper that's the sun.
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you do that, you're successful.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's also to illustrate that the team knows exactly what the sun is.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just because I've described it one way and you've described it a different way doesn't mean it's a different thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: It just means we have different communication styles.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that communication style and getting hung up on that occurs.
[SPEAKER_10]: totally hypocritical because I started the whole conversation by saying, your sentence implies this thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: My mom is an English teacher.
[SPEAKER_10]: This was critical in my whole life of saying, there is the best way of saying things.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not the only way.
[SPEAKER_10]: And sometimes it's not even the best way.
[SPEAKER_10]: But the exercise about the picture of the sun
[SPEAKER_10]: is illustrative.
[SPEAKER_10]: And by the way, please steal that idea.
[SPEAKER_10]: Use it with every group.
[SPEAKER_10]: Use it with your family.
[SPEAKER_10]: Use it with your loved one.
[SPEAKER_10]: Use it with people who are you having challenges with.
[SPEAKER_10]: Go look.
[SPEAKER_10]: Get a piece of paper.
[SPEAKER_10]: Draw a picture of the sun.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hand it to me.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to be different than the one I give you, but it means we both are talking about the same thing, the sun, just in a different way.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's figure out how we can make those commonalities work.
[SPEAKER_10]: and not worry about the nuanced differences of how we're describing it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Some people are way better at that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Women are way better at that than men are.
[SPEAKER_10]: But that doesn't mean men are inadequate.
[SPEAKER_10]: It just means they're different in that context.
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, expressing what's in your brain, using air and my mouth to manipulate sound,
[SPEAKER_10]: so that you can understand the idea that's in my brain is, to me, the most amazing thing ever in the world, in the universe, in history, period.
[SPEAKER_10]: The fact that I can take some crazy idea in my head, use some kind of sound, and you kind of understand what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_10]: It is a lifelong fascination and a lifelong passion.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, the commonality aspect, and this really applies to sales is, and I can write a whole book on this on the angle, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: The angle.
[SPEAKER_08]: So what is that angle that aligns the conversation with the prospect?
[SPEAKER_08]: And typically it's, hey, you're a girl dad, so am I, or hey, you like soccer, so do I, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: So like, what is that angle in with the prospect to
[SPEAKER_08]: To your point, Andy, like that commonality connection in the conversation.
[SPEAKER_08]: It really works wonders right on breaking the ice and furthering the conversation and progressing it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so yeah, well said and thanks to Adele for coming up.
[SPEAKER_08]: We know you're busy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you so much and thanks Danielle for grabbing the co-host and.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we'll go to Hoops, and then we'll go to Timo.
[SPEAKER_08]: And yeah, it's been a great conversation so far, guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for being here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Please check out our sponsor, Play, and it's an AI ads-powered platform, trying to promote them more.
[SPEAKER_08]: And yeah, Hoops, over to you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, morning, Justin, Andy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, Danielle, good to see you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Good to hear everybody's voice, Timo.
[SPEAKER_07]: um great to hear thanks for the space man as always as always it's always a pleasure to come in and and rev the day get the day revving you know this is always a beautiful beautiful space for that man really appreciate this room um i heard you speaking about um what the andy said earlier or i think you founded a quote it basically said if you're under a million if you're under a million in revenues annually
[SPEAKER_07]: That means no one sees or hears you.
[SPEAKER_07]: That means you got to advertise more.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that was from Hermosi, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's good.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a good one.
[SPEAKER_07]: I read that this morning.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um,
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we're talking about failures and I'm, I'm looking at my, my back office cause I'm running a couple, you know, affiliate programs and I'm, I'm saying to myself, these, I have a hundred and 130, uh, affiliates and it was only like 40, 45 that converted in this, this account.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I don't know how to get to the rest of those, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Because they didn't come in.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not like I had a newsletter or something like that where I was able to capture emails or they came in on an affiliate link.
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyway, that kind of moved me to make some decisions and make some moves.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, because of that and looking at this every day, um, and can't get the context because if I'm DMing them, the DMs aren't allowed right now, so I can't even DM them.
[SPEAKER_07]: But, um, anyway, so yeah, that's been, that's been a sore spot to me because that's like money left on the table.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, they're already, they're already.
[SPEAKER_07]: made an initial move, they just hasn't gone through the full process.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's that's really sitting pretty bad.
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyway, it's enabled me to make some of the moves just to make sure that I might not be in this position again.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, so I'm dealing with I'm dealing with that right now, that little failure right there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so let me share some tips there, Hoops.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, number one, when it comes to affiliate marketing, like number one is, you know, obviously you have their X profiles, but ideally, if you can get their email address too, that would be great.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, driving them to a landing page is like, you know, 101, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: So just drive them to a basic landing page.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you need some inspiration, you can check out the,
[SPEAKER_08]: The pin posts I did above for a sample landing page, um, that highlights the affiliate program and highlights, you know.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what it is, what's beneficial to them and then email capture, which I don't have on this 1, but, um.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not taking my own advice here but the most of these people already have I already have their emails but the point is you want to capture their email that's that's number one because it's going to require follow-up and you can follow up via email you can follow up via dms but you got to have multiple follow-up touch points and even as a pro tip uh cell phone numbers you know
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, people may, you know, oh, I don't want to ask for their cell phone number.
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, well, of those 100 people that you've had, just think about if you had their email address and you had their phone number, there's a high likelihood that you'd be following up and just, you know, helping them through the process and get them converted.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So those are just a couple pro tips off the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, people, the reality is people need multiple touch points.
[SPEAKER_08]: They need multiple follow ups.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you know, this happens with every single ad campaign I run too, is you will have people that convert right away, but majority of them will not.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that requires follow up and follow through, and that's reality.
[SPEAKER_08]: So hopefully that's helpful.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hoops hang on the stage.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to go to Fabio.
[SPEAKER_08]: I skipped him.
[SPEAKER_08]: My apologies Fabio.
[SPEAKER_08]: I see my phone is glitching here so.
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, Fabio, how's it going man over to you?
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, Justin, how's it going?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand how how glitchy X can be X spaces.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me say hi also to Andy, Daniel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good to see you as a host here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hoops, Peter and all the amazing people down on listeners.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to say hi.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do want to say hi to each one, but I have to to be mindful of the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to share my thoughts on this.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a really, really big Brazilian creator.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what he's, and he does like, he has lives that he, I think he has like weekly lives where he teaches people something.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he is really good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that he might be like the biggest creator in Brazil right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one thing that he says is,
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is something that's very typical in Brazil.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll hear a lot of people say this, but I think he's going to, I don't know, he's going to spread this word even further away.
[SPEAKER_03]: He says, if you don't appear, you disappear.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that that's the easiest way to think about how to remain relevant.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that a lot of the times it's about just appearing, just being there.
[SPEAKER_03]: predictably being there.
[SPEAKER_03]: People, if you're building an audience, I think that people want to hear you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that the way that you stay relevant is making sure that you appear at the times that you are expected to appear.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you also keep on expanding your circle of contacts of audience as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that this is a fascinating topic.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: different ways we could talk about this, but I just wanted to share this because, yeah, great topic, Justin.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to make sure that I shared my peace as well, my peace of mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, thank you, Fabio.
[SPEAKER_08]: Always a pleasure, my man.
[SPEAKER_08]: And yeah, that's a good one.
[SPEAKER_08]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I took that down and I captured it for everyone there in the comments.
[SPEAKER_08]: Where did it go?
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want to see it here.
[SPEAKER_08]: I saw it here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, if you don't, if you don't appear, you disappear.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's that's that's solid.
[SPEAKER_08]: And yeah, and here's how you know, like,
[SPEAKER_08]: And your community and your connections will tell you, like they'll tell you like, wow, Justin, what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_08]: Like you are like everywhere.
[SPEAKER_08]: Or man, Danielle, I'm seeing you everywhere.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they'll tell you, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: They'll give you that feedback.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's what you want, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: You want your prospects, your community, your customers, you know, everyone to say and acknowledge like, wow, you know, I've seen you everywhere.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is, you know, when I worked at companies,
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I was a master at retargeting ads and Facebook ads, Google ads.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they'd go to a conference and they'd be like, man, who's doing your digital and social media, man?
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm seeing you guys everywhere.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's what you want, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: You want that because that's what's memorable.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what keeps you memorable.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what keeps you relevant and top of mind.
[SPEAKER_08]: And brand awareness is a thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's just requiring more touch points in the past.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the only difference, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: So to stay relevant, that's just reality.
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you for that contribution, Fabio.
[SPEAKER_08]: And Edwin, I see you, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have to make a comment to you real quick.
[SPEAKER_08]: Man, go on LinkedIn and like some of my posts, man, because I see you on there and I'm liking your stuff, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, hopefully you're seeing my stuff as well, Edwin.
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, just go on there and like a couple of my posts.
[SPEAKER_08]: I would really appreciate it because I see you on LinkedIn.
[SPEAKER_08]: I see the work that you're doing, man, and I love it.
[SPEAKER_08]: So go like some of my posts as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hopefully they're showing up for you.
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, keep up the great work you're doing, Edwin.
[SPEAKER_08]: Always a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_08]: Fibonacci man.
[SPEAKER_08]: So all right, awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, let's go to Timo.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we're going to go to Christelle.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then guys, if you want to come up and share anything else, please come up on stage.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to go to like 745, 750, depending on the conversation.
[SPEAKER_08]: And yeah, let's go to Timo.
[SPEAKER_08]: Timo, how's it going, man?
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good morning to you guys and ladies.
[SPEAKER_04]: across the pond.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, great day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, kind of a long day.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just finished my round of beehive clicks and hopped onto the space.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, this is a great topic.
[SPEAKER_04]: At Wheel of Space, we were talking about this kind of similar topic.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was mentioning that I'm in
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see, Tuesday, well, pretty much the entire week I've been writing about kind of leveraging other people's audiences and other people's authority and other people's, well, just reach.
[SPEAKER_04]: And discussing about what not to do and what to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yesterday on Wheel Space, I was,
[SPEAKER_04]: mentioning that for instance here on X these spaces are one of the easiest ways to build trust and one of the best ways to kind of tap into other people's audience because sometimes these spaces are huge and if you hop on and grab the mic and it doesn't even have to be huge
[SPEAKER_04]: If it's in your niche and you hop on, just like Kevin has said, he has closed many deals out of these spaces and I've gotten connections and I've gotten gigs from just hopping into these spaces.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, rejections and how do you stay reluctant?
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're lingering around with the people that are like-minded and are doing the kindest same stuff, you really don't want to try and monetize those.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's one of the biggest mistakes here on social media.
[SPEAKER_04]: People think that they can gather audience and then just blatantly monetize them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, no, those are the people that you want to build relationships, like this entire speaker panel here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We know each other from two years or something like that, or even more.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm not trying to monetize.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sending BPMs to you to
[SPEAKER_04]: download my digital products or buy my services.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of you approach me for that, though, and that's totally fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what the magic happens when you guys talk and you guys tag other people.
[SPEAKER_04]: For instance, you could tag me for, hey, if you want to learn about cybersecurity or if you want to learn about
[SPEAKER_04]: how to launch a beehive newsletter, just tag Timo.
[SPEAKER_04]: And lo and behold, things happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the best way to stay relevant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nurture your friendships and nurture your relationships with the important people that are close to you, your friends.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they'll do the marketing.
[SPEAKER_04]: and the rejections are not an issue then.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not that guy who's going to dissent.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though Kevin says it's money, I'm not going to send 100 DMs.
[SPEAKER_04]: I get enough from my 95 to just go above and beyond.
[SPEAKER_04]: But in order to build these revenue streams, I want them to be on a solid ground.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not just like some randos buying a $5 ebook.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want them to be there because they value what I have to offer.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, avoid rejections by not pushing yourself everywhere.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I love that Timo.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: And yeah, like the relationships you meet.
[SPEAKER_08]: The people that you add value to their lives, you know, all around, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Like they will promote you.
[SPEAKER_08]: They will promote you and and that word of mouth marketing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nothing is more powerful than word of mouth marketing at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I don't care how many campaigns you run, how many ads you launch, how many emails you send.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like the true power is when you're in an audio space or.
[SPEAKER_08]: Even a live event and you stand up and you give a testimonial and you say, hey,
[SPEAKER_08]: You need to work with Andy and here's why.
[SPEAKER_08]: And here's the transformation he helped me achieve.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you know, nothing's more powerful than that at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's happened.
[SPEAKER_08]: The byproduct of the relationships is the transformation is the value is the more revenue is the fill in the blank, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just a byproduct of the relationship.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, but yeah, wise words, Timo.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well said, I couldn't agree more.
[SPEAKER_08]: And yeah, like two years into this journey, literally like to the day here and of my five year plan.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a five year plan and I'm two years into it and it's been an exciting journey and.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you Timo for your friendship and it's been great collaborations and yeah, I remember that time when you know Netta introduced us on a space and then yeah, it was just.
[SPEAKER_08]: Brotherhood at the beginning.
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then come to find out, you know, you have all these other similarities.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what's great about space is you learn something new about somebody each time, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: And as you develop the relationship and it grows,
[SPEAKER_08]: you find out like how many more interests and commonalities you have with people.
[SPEAKER_08]: And yeah, I mean, just like hoops and SDSU grad.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I mean, just so many things.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is why spaces are so addictive and they're my favorite thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: And look, I told Andy and I told everyone if I could go on spaces every day and do this every day, which I'm already doing.
[SPEAKER_08]: But if I could do more of it, I would.
[SPEAKER_08]: And once I hit 20K a month, I will.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll spend as much time as I can on here to add value and help people.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's a form of.
[SPEAKER_07]: So would you, would you, Justin, would you consider this some sort of
[SPEAKER_07]: like guerrilla marketing because we're reaching out and we can touch each other, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: So with guerrilla marketing, IRL, you can sort of reach, you can reach and touch people.
[SPEAKER_07]: So obviously the communication.
[SPEAKER_09]: Please don't touch me, please.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want to be touched today.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to reach out and touch somebody out and touch somebody, you know, you just got to reach out and touch.
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, when you when when you advertise, you don't get a chance to reach out and touch those people because they're they're coming in from, you know, the advertising.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's two different.
[SPEAKER_07]: Set of markets so to speak you got your it has a name people are talking about it.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're calling it Social audio marketing.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm finally hearing like big influencers people on YouTube Giving it a name.
[SPEAKER_09]: It has a name social audio marketing.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a real thing and we're doing it.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're doing it.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just so new that it's like
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, the baby just got named, but I'll go ahead and sneak in here since you said I was next.
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyways, I'm going to come in on hoops.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks, hoops.
[SPEAKER_09]: I got got the ball.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to shoot it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it went in swish swish.
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, October is four years since I started.
[SPEAKER_09]: I started on Clubhouse four years ago.
[SPEAKER_09]: Monique and Lucia were two of my first community members.
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't even know what I was doing, but somebody was like, do you have a community?
[SPEAKER_09]: I was like, I could build one.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I did, you know, and it's, I've had four since I'm on my fourth one.
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, I don't want you all to get too jealous, but.
[SPEAKER_09]: Jodell and I are going to be seeing each other on Sunday.
[SPEAKER_09]: She's going to be here in Miami with her mama, and I'm going to be with my mama and we're going to have a mother daughter double date.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the cool thing about this is that this was planned early in the year.
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't remember when.
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe she'll let me know.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I know it was early in the year.
[SPEAKER_09]: I would guess it was around March or April.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I remember when she told me, I was like, oh my gosh, that's so far away.
[SPEAKER_09]: But time moves so fast.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to be here before you know it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And now it's Thursday.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, we're like, oh, we got to make reservations.
[SPEAKER_09]: We got to, like, get this party started.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to have some fancy girl brunch and, you know, do the really cute things.
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe I'll get my hair did six months.
[SPEAKER_09]: OK, she said it was six months ago.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yeah, that's about April.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'll answer the question quickly, because I know you're closing up.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, but I can't wait to see her.
[SPEAKER_09]: I told my mom, I'm like, you're going to love this woman.
[SPEAKER_09]: She's a franchise owner.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, how many franchise owners do y'all know, OK, that you can say you're friends with?
[SPEAKER_09]: Because, you know, I mean, except for Jodell.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, Jodell.
[SPEAKER_09]: She's so cool.
[SPEAKER_09]: And she just wrote a book like Danielle.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like here, I feel cool being on X because I can be like, I'm friends with women that published books.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_09]: I have Danielle's book sitting in my living room, and Jodell's is about to be right there next to hers.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm so bullish on X, and I'm so glad you are too, Justin, because I totally feel you about
[SPEAKER_09]: More money more spaces when people are like, oh no, I'm gonna make a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I never do spaces I'm like y'all are wild I'm trying to make as much money as I can and Do the least amount that I have to so that I can be on spaces as much as I want because to me that means like Things are going well also VB is here and I meant to say this days ago, but I'm gonna say it right now and then I'm gonna start to land the plane and
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope you never turn these into subscriber only spaces because what I love about them is that they are public and it's like it's the best community service ever and I'm sure VB supports this 100% and I feel what he means also by you know the subscriber only but
[SPEAKER_09]: I just love how open it is.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a public forum, and you get the best speakers.
[SPEAKER_09]: Look who your co-hosts are.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're pulling in top dogs.
[SPEAKER_09]: You got Hoops in here, and Timo, and even in the audience.
[SPEAKER_09]: Every day people come.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's more valuable than any dollar amount.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can't put
[SPEAKER_09]: Price and that's how you stay relevant is you put your focus on things that don't even have there They'll never be trendy Okay, see people think community is trendy right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're just late like community is literally the beginning I'm over here reading Psalms, by the way, Andy and like you're all in it things that Andy says I'm like reading inscription like man this man, you know, listen It's the other way around
[SPEAKER_10]: It's everything I say comes from the Bible.
[SPEAKER_10]: If it doesn't come from the Bible, I probably don't say it.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's so true.
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, it's good.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Psalms 101, that whole chapter.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it talks in there about what the non-negotiables are.
[SPEAKER_09]: And one of those is liars.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm thinking of Andy the other day when we talked about non-negotiables.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's like, liars, non-negotiables.
[SPEAKER_09]: So anyways, that's how you stay relevant.
[SPEAKER_09]: You match yourself with the coolest people that are really smart and doing things and building and publishing, whether it's here, LinkedIn, or wherever it is.
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, do things that are timeless.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is why I love newsletters, and this is actually what I'm landing with.
[SPEAKER_09]: I had someone that I met in a group networking event.
[SPEAKER_09]: We had our one-on-one call yesterday, and he says, okay, Christelle, you're right.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know how I know you're right?
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I asked ChatGPT.
[SPEAKER_09]: I did research, and I asked ChatGPT, are newsletters better than social media marketing based on ROIs and all the other things?
[SPEAKER_09]: Language that I don't even speak.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's from the corporate world, okay?
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm from the public school district of DC.
[SPEAKER_09]: So forgive me, in Florida educated.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I did go to great schools.
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyways, so he's proved it with himself on ChatGBT, and then he's like, okay, I want a newsletter now.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you can do this with people.
[SPEAKER_09]: If they don't believe you that newsletters are where it's at, then take them to ChatGBT, because even ChatGBT is, yeah, vouching for it.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's how you stay relevant, do things that are timeless.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, that's all, thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: And thank you, Christelle, because you've been on my case like...
[SPEAKER_07]: Look, man, you got to put that thing up.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's up now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks to Timo.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got my newsletter up.
[SPEAKER_07]: I wrote a couple e-books.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'm moving along.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's because of y'all.
[SPEAKER_07]: So appreciate y'all.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm about to get the paid plans so that you can get that ad monetization.
[SPEAKER_09]: I got it on day one.
[SPEAKER_09]: I couldn't believe it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I already had ads in there like they're not playing around with the ads.
[SPEAKER_09]: They want to make money.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they do.
[SPEAKER_06]: They do.
[SPEAKER_06]: They do.
[SPEAKER_06]: They do.
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, the takeaway here is look if you if you help other people make money like you're going to have a good business, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Like that, that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: And when we talk about it, it's a good reminder here and welcome to the stage.
[SPEAKER_08]: Will we're going to go a couple extra minutes?
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause I want to hear from Will.
[SPEAKER_08]: I couldn't make his space yesterday because I had client work, but I want to hear from Will.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's been on my mind lately.
[SPEAKER_08]: It must be his.
[SPEAKER_08]: His audio thing that he did, he's, he's getting in for my subconscious.
[SPEAKER_09]: This man is brilliant.
[SPEAKER_08]: So he's getting into my subconscious even more.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, um, so thank you, Will.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was just manifesting your presence here.
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, like getting back to the key components that you need, help people make more money, help people save time, help people increase their productivity.
[SPEAKER_08]: and help people transform, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: And so however that looks for you, but if you can do all four, great.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you can do a combination of a few, even better.
[SPEAKER_08]: But really, those are the main questions that you have to answer.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's my whole brand is like, you know, and my guarantee is, if you implement in 90 days, these teachings,
[SPEAKER_08]: from my newsletter, from the spaces, from the website, from the blog, everything.
[SPEAKER_08]: You will make more revenue.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no question as long as you execute it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right?
[SPEAKER_08]: And so there's no question.
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, just want to put that out there.
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, let's go over to Will real quickly and then we're going to start wrapping up here guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: Really appreciate everyone being here.
[SPEAKER_08]: VB, Jason, Fabio, Edwin.
[SPEAKER_08]: Make sure you like my posts on LinkedIn, Edwin.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to keep reminding you.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, but yeah, let's go over to Will.
[SPEAKER_08]: Will, how's it going?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, good morning, Justin.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't make the majority of the space.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to pop out and get some grocery shopping done, but, um, yeah, I've really been enjoying this journey of entrepreneurship and I've been implementing exactly what you've been saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the, the monetization now on school is live.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm getting people on boarded.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I mean, very transparent with the way I'm doing it and it's, it's
[SPEAKER_01]: It has been a very rewarding part of the journey, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: To see people literally opt in and say, well, how can I pay you?
[SPEAKER_01]: And now that I have an answer to that for people who don't want the full coaching package, now the MRR is going up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've got a lot of that to thank for you, Justin and Andy and Christelle as well for giving me a push.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it really is very gratifying to see the work we do
[SPEAKER_01]: be reflected in the results.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I only caught a moment or two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, very nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I only got a moment or two of this conversation so far, but you were saying, if you help people earn more money, that you have a good business.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was thinking the other day, after what Andy challenged me on, it's like, what exactly do I bring to that game?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I realized, well, what I do is I help people stay optimized.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that they do earn more money because now they don't spiral.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now they don't spend weeks in self-doubt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now they don't procrastinate for months on end.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now they can be an efficient operator.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I help them do it with peace of mind, which is what they want the money for in the first place.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, those are my reflections.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't, I didn't catch the topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do I stay relevant after rejections?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm always relevant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I get rejected, it's just a lesson.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, thanks, Will.
[SPEAKER_08]: Love that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's so fun to watch Will just leveling up, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, everyone, but each person is like, and Will, you are in our subconscious.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I do, because, you know, it's in scripture.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's all there.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's written.
[SPEAKER_09]: But good job.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm so I love it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm here for you.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm on school.
[SPEAKER_09]: I signed up.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to see.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to see.
[SPEAKER_09]: So far, it's looking good.
[SPEAKER_09]: But anyways, thanks, Will, for being here and for coming and speaking always.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, what I will say, Christelle, is the bulk of the community is free to join.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a daily practice that is free for everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all it will cost you is five.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, but you're probably going to get my money because I believe you when you say that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, what I will say to that is I will never say no to money because I'm a source of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so are you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the the primary goal of the community and I've said this many times and it's literally inside the body of the community now is nobody goes more than 24 hours without a chance for recalibration.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's free.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that process, you don't need me for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I make a daily video.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's there to guide you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's up to you to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want my help to do it, that you can pay for.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the way to do it, the way is made.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way to do it is there for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just walk the path.
[SPEAKER_07]: Gotta love school.
[SPEAKER_07]: Gotta love school.
[SPEAKER_07]: Glad to see you guys are on school as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah and I won't make these ever paid subscriber only spaces here like these ones like I will never do that and you guys have my word on that.
[SPEAKER_08]: When I do have the ability to to have subscribers like pay me or whatever you know I may do some subscriber only spaces but I will always have like the dailies you know non-paid and we're heading into I don't know if you guys heard my big announcement but
[SPEAKER_08]: The other day, so I'm committing to another year of spaces starting next year.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm announcing it now.
[SPEAKER_08]: So there you go.
[SPEAKER_08]: So You'll you'll have more of more of the the revenue Ronin here heading into 2026 Daily spaces Monday through Friday with bonus optional Saturday and Sunday pop-ups, of course because you know, I
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are spicy, but but yeah, rest assured, rest assured.
[SPEAKER_08]: So Christelle, no need to worry.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're good.
[SPEAKER_09]: So this actually makes me happy, like genuine happiness, joy in my heart.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm so excited.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome alright guys well hey we're gonna start wrapping up here so we'll do final words here we'll go to Will, Hoops, Christelle, Timo, Andy and Danielle and just keep it to a minute guys and would really appreciate it and yeah another great space started off a bit slow very inner reflection uh reflectionary but hey we've we've come around here it's been a great conversation so I appreciate
[SPEAKER_08]: everyone's contributions to the conversation today.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Thursday.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to be doing wins for the week tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, let's go around the horn here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Will, final word over to you, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, final word.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I'm giving, I feel like I'm getting a lot of stage time here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to speak to the topic at hand, how do you stay relevant?
[SPEAKER_01]: You realize that you always are.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's always one person that you're relevant to, and that's yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your subconscious is always listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you say that thing outside me happened and now I am less than I was before, you have given your power away to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's making a false God.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We realize that the circumstance is neutral and that you can grant it any meaning you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got rejected.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the lesson, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you do that, you're operating from a place of power.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you say I am less because the world told me, so you've taken the power to create your state and given it away.
[SPEAKER_01]: I invite you to take it back.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dang, I love it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, thanks Will.
[SPEAKER_08]: Always a pleasure to have you on stage, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: And yeah, stay in that power, guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: Stay in that power.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what it's all about.
[SPEAKER_08]: So good stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, Hoops, over to you.
[SPEAKER_07]: You always, you always have to give people the opportunity to tell, you know, I mean, that's just the bottom line.
[SPEAKER_07]: You start from that angle.
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't matter what the hell they say.
[SPEAKER_07]: You were already expecting it.
[SPEAKER_07]: If it's a yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then you move forward and you deal with the yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's that simple.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're going, if you're going to it, knowing that you're giving them an opportunity to tell, you know, but they did not tell you, no, okay, good.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's, let's do some business.
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you did tell me, no, I was expecting that.
[SPEAKER_07]: No.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's not gonna affect me in any way.
[SPEAKER_07]: So therefore I can make a thousand phone calls with that attitude.
[SPEAKER_07]: Y'all can tell me no a thousand times.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was expecting it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Why because I'm giving you the opportunity to tell me no It's it's that simple, but I want to thank you guys man.
[SPEAKER_07]: You you you guys are awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got my
[SPEAKER_07]: I got my, my, my stuff up now, you know, I'm, I'm, I'm feeling good about that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, uh, yeah, I'm doing some pretty cool writing me and my chat GPT, having some great fun and you people should too.
[SPEAKER_07]: The tools are there to be used.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, at my stage of the game right now, I'm looking at things that I'm doing and I hear as people come into the room, I hear people say some things on this platform.
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't want to achieve this.
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't want to achieve that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm saying to myself, so why are you on the platform?
[SPEAKER_07]: The platform is all about.
[SPEAKER_07]: getting better, becoming a better you, especially these rooms.
[SPEAKER_07]: If that's the attitude you're going to take, don't come in these rooms and don't share that on these stages.
[SPEAKER_07]: Go find another place where you can be what you want to be.
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, people are affecting in a variety of different ways.
[SPEAKER_07]: But these rooms are absolutely important.
[SPEAKER_07]: Appreciate you, Justin.
[SPEAKER_07]: Appreciate everybody here.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, give them the opportunity to tell, you know, if you will go into it with that attitude, you'll never you'll never
[SPEAKER_07]: Freak on a note.
[SPEAKER_07]: I get in your life.
[SPEAKER_07]: Appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's pure gold right there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like you.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the mindset you need going into every opportunity is you're giving them the opportunity, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, hey.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, you're giving them the opportunity that that's positioning right there.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's positioning in from a place of power and confidence.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if they, you know, it's not for them right now, completely fine.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no worries, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: So love that perspective hoops.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's 1000% on on point as usual.
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you for that hoops.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, like we're given.
[SPEAKER_08]: No sweat off my back if, you know, I'm giving you this opportunity.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're not at a point right now where you can take it, you know, no worries, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Because, you know, and what they'll find out is come next year when they may be ready, guess what the reality is?
[SPEAKER_08]: My prices are more expensive.
[SPEAKER_08]: My time is more valuable.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the only difference.
[SPEAKER_08]: So they'll be willing to, if they see that growth, that's part of positioning power plays as well, is they'll see, wow, man, I should have invested in the Ronin community last year when it was more affordable, or I should have hired Justin as a fractional CMO last year, because now he's more expensive, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: And that goes for all of us.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're only going to become more expensive in the near future
[SPEAKER_08]: Will's playing it out live for us, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: So, yeah, keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_08]: So thanks, Hoop, for that reminder.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, let's go to Christelle, and then we'll go to Timo, Andy, and Danielle.

[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, let's go Andy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_08]: Timo, Andy, then Danielle.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so just a quick one here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, just don't be the one that the younglings nowadays call pick-me-girl.
[SPEAKER_04]: So don't be that, and you'll stay relevant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Justin, I love it how you are pushing Edwin about liking your posts on LinkedIn.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate that platform, but I am there because
[SPEAKER_04]: I do network with my local AI people on the government space.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's what I use it for basically.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just like every three months I post maybe something in Finnish.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, so that's, that's my LinkedIn game.
[SPEAKER_04]: But today I came across your post and it was you talking about branding and he had like gazillion monitors.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like three days old post.
[SPEAKER_04]: And on none of them I saw the revenueroaning.com site.
[SPEAKER_04]: What a bummer, so I trolled you a bit on the comments.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a good one, great space as always.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah, that's an old picture.
[SPEAKER_08]: I need to update that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Timo, thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I need to update that setup.
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, thank you for that reminder.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now that I got the new website, I got to redo that.
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you for that reminder.
[SPEAKER_08]: And yes, Edwin, please go like my stuff on LinkedIn.
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's another reminder.
[SPEAKER_08]: Please like my stuff on LinkedIn, Edwin.
[SPEAKER_08]: I see you over there, Edwin.
[SPEAKER_08]: I see you, brother.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, please.
[SPEAKER_08]: Por favor, por tu amigo, por tu mejor amigo in these X-treats, OK?
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Timo.
[SPEAKER_08]: Always a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, final word over to you, Andy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then we'll go to Danielle.
[SPEAKER_10]: Relevance is your choice.
[SPEAKER_10]: Rejection is what happens.
[SPEAKER_10]: Who cares?
[SPEAKER_10]: Keep going.
[SPEAKER_10]: Keep going.
[SPEAKER_10]: Keep going.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then keep going some more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I know I'm up to bat.
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, Justin's message to Ed over there is really for all of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're on LinkedIn, go comment on Justin's stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, message received.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty consistent with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to give a shout out to Will.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that, you know, Will is really on point when he's talking about self-worth, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: When we talk about rejection and relevance, it all comes down to how we handle that and how we pursue is based on, you know, our self-worth, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And rejection we're talking about today, it doesn't define your worth, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But it does expose how much you believe in it, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: When I get very clear on my value, rejection, when it happens to me, it stops feeling personal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where there's a turning point.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not personal.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a dead end.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a redirection.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so as long as I can continue to sign up, like, you know, show up with that kind of self-belief,
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the thing the same doors that were closed yesterday.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're open next week next month, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a dead end.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it's just a pause and then that pause you get to pivot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm all about the pivot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for letting me share.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, thanks for co-hosting today.
[SPEAKER_08]: Danielle really enjoyed having you on stage and.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, well, another great space, guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: Redirection.
[SPEAKER_08]: Rejection is just redirection.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all it is.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so you have to embrace it.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you look at all the numbers, it's a numbers game at the end of the day and just embrace it.
[SPEAKER_08]: That next no is just your next move to that next yes is all it is.
[SPEAKER_08]: And just keep stacking those yeses and we'll be stacking those wins.
[SPEAKER_08]: And tomorrow we're celebrating our wins for the week.
[SPEAKER_08]: And why do we do that?
[SPEAKER_08]: Because majority is just lessons learned, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Just lessons learned of learnings throughout the journey.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's the way towards mastery.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, guys, at the end of our lives, we'll ask ourselves four simple questions.
[SPEAKER_08]: Did I live?
[SPEAKER_08]: Did I love?
[SPEAKER_08]: Did I matter?
[SPEAKER_08]: Did I make a difference?
[SPEAKER_08]: Until next time, keep making a difference.
[SPEAKER_08]: Build that mind, build that body, build that business, build that bank account, and most importantly, build that legacy.
[SPEAKER_08]: So stay hungry and stay humble.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see you guys at the top.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you want to keep growing, check out the Revenue Ronin and make it a productive and profitable day.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we'll see you back tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_08]: And make sure you go like Edwin.
[SPEAKER_08]: Make sure you go like my post on LinkedIn.
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, much love guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: See you tomorrow.
