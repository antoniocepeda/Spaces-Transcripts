[SPEAKER_08]: I'm good.
[SPEAKER_08]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_08]: Happy.
[SPEAKER_08]: What is it Tuesday?
[SPEAKER_08]: Tuesday is my favorite day that ends in wine And you know, I make that joke all the time.
[SPEAKER_08]: You want to know I think I told the story of I Was having a really bad project on the other side of the world away from my family away from everything It was really bad and I asked my team What's how do we determine if it's a good day or not?
[SPEAKER_08]: And they said breathing and billing long story, but breathing and billing if you wake up, it's a good day
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're able to go get a chance to make money, it's a good day.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's how we define a good day.
[SPEAKER_08]: You wake up with a day that ends in Y, and you got a shot at it.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's why it's good.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, and today is also one of my favorite days.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's bonfire day in England.
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember, remember the 5th of November?
[SPEAKER_08]: Guy Fawkes and the guy that wanted to burn down Parliament.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's always a fantastic day for that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And being in the kind of Ronin-ish idea that,
[SPEAKER_08]: got to do your own thing, not necessarily the big giant thing, then I'm all for that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, happy Guy Fawkes Day.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you don't know what that is, look it up.
[SPEAKER_08]: F-A-W-K-E-S.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a fantastic story.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, thank you, Andy.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a great movie.
[SPEAKER_05]: The, yeah, the 5th of November, whatever that is.
[SPEAKER_05]: V for Vendetta.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a great movie.
[SPEAKER_04]: Andy?
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate to tell you, it's the 4th.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tomorrow is the 5th.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't rush my week.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Patricia, thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: My goodness.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_07]: I even posted on my timeline.
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember the 5th.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Blow it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, you know what?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to do that tomorrow too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say, that's tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_03]: My week is already kind of crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't rush me past.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to double check the date.
[SPEAKER_08]: And happy belated birthday.
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't talked to you since your birthday.
[SPEAKER_08]: So happy birthday.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a great time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um But I do have to say I remember thinking last year when it came to elections Everything was up and was gonna be up in the air crazy Who knows who knew what the hell we were gonna get?
[SPEAKER_04]: because if you look back the UK election was on the 4th of July and the US election was on the 5th of November and
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, this does not happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Birthday is awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, sorry, Justin.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll go sit back down.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Happy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hope you had a great birthday.
[SPEAKER_05]: I messaged you in the DM chat.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I did.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: My DMs, my timeline under a space was just flooded.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I still have to learn how to manage that, but I'm getting there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd rather have to manage it than not.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I had a great time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Avni is like one of the world's best co-hosts.
[SPEAKER_04]: Seven hours, two glitches, but we still managed it all.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know that I will do another seven hour space until next year, but
[SPEAKER_04]: I had fun, so it was worth it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's awesome, Patricia.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, shout out to you again.
[SPEAKER_05]: Happy birthday.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, those spaces, I mean, man, Famous does 24-hour spaces.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, talk about next level.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I don't know how he does it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to say, I don't know how he does it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Avni had never heard of him.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think we might see her pop in tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I was like, no, you have to meet things.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to meet him.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, thanks for being here, Patricia.
[SPEAKER_05]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And really looking forward to hearing what you're building in public and why you're building in public.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I want to recognize a couple people real quickly.
[SPEAKER_05]: So shout out to Edwin Edwin down below, uh, guys, I have great news to report.
[SPEAKER_05]: Edwin took my.
[SPEAKER_05]: call to action and he started liking some of my posts on LinkedIn.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm very grateful and honored.
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you Edwin for that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, this goes to show that like when you do calls to action and they resonate with people, right, you got to make calls to action.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to do it right.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to do it even if it's as subtle as hey would you mind liking my post.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey would you mind commenting.
[SPEAKER_05]: Would you mind checking out my email.
[SPEAKER_05]: Subscribing to my email.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Get you know book a call with me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: You need to incorporate calls to action in your marketing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't stress this enough because you want people to take an action.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: You put out great content.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_05]: But make sure you give people a call to action.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now sometimes
[SPEAKER_05]: the content doesn't require a call to action, that's fine.
[SPEAKER_05]: But majority of the time, you want to make sure it's a call to action, even if it's drop a comment, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So shout out to you, Edwin.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks so much.
[SPEAKER_05]: Really great to connect with you on LinkedIn, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're doing some great work over there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And guys, make sure you're following Edwin.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's been a great friend on this platform for a long time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, great to have you aboard today, Edwin.
[SPEAKER_05]: And shout out to
[SPEAKER_05]: Aneta and Jason Digital Growth Stack.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love that name.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good to see you, Jason.
[SPEAKER_05]: And let's go over to Danielle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy Tuesday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we're getting the dates right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm laughing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Call to action.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, critical and easy to forget.
[SPEAKER_01]: but I don't know if it was a call to action.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last time I was on this space, it was more of a call out than a call to action.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know what, you made it so funny in your consistency and it was playful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a good reminder that we can have some fun when we're really trying to make our point and drive it home.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the end result was good.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got your likes, but what you got more than that was you got your connection.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now, you know, you guys are forever bonded on LinkedIn because of that conversation, that public playfulness, I call it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So,
[SPEAKER_01]: your sisters over here, you know, things have been busy and busy is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I have slipped into, and this is both bad and good, is my second book, which I'd started months ago and then just kind of left it on the back burner.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just couldn't, like I couldn't be married to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what to tell you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now, now it's like, if somebody takes my computer away, I am sad.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, I feel like a five-year-old, like give me my lollipop back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I find myself stealing time just to visit the characters and the story that's evolving in this book.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is so delicious but I need to exercise some self-restraint because while I do want to get this out in January, maybe February.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a bit of a distraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for anybody who, like whatever it is you like the most, like me, I like writing the most.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know what's cool, guys?
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to share this very quickly, because what are we putting out there?
[SPEAKER_01]: I am working on this in Word.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I did WTF, I did it in Google Docs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when the people said to me that we're going to format it, they were like, OK, you've got to put it in Word.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how we operate in the real world.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't even know how to use Word.
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew what Word was, but I didn't understand page breaks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't understand layouts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't understand how to do setup or nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And margins.
[SPEAKER_01]: It intimidated the hell out of me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I sit here now in this season and I revisit all those things, I can see earlier Danielle, which was only a year ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can just celebrate your growth and you remember the pain that it took to get through whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, that might sound silly because it's just formatting.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for me, that was daunting and just above my abilities, even though there's a lot of other things I could do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just so cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll see me on spaces, off spaces.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I am in the deep dive of this novel.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what I got to share.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, thank you for that reminder, Danielle, to celebrate our growth.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because yes, the journey can be arduous, it can be stressful, and what better place to celebrate our growth than on X spaces?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's for building in public, for what we're doing here, especially around solopreneurs, small businesses, and founders, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to compound those wins and celebrate those wins.
[SPEAKER_05]: that fuels us right that where's the fuel it's in the small winds and you know if you look at the whole year like look at how long how much growth you've had in one year and it really compounds right it compounds and that we forget this we forget this so um it's a good reminder for everyone thank you for that danielle and i couldn't agree more and uh and yeah like literally
[SPEAKER_05]: I was writing a post yesterday about, you know, two years being on this platform, two years, like literally October was like my two year mark of basically being active every day for two years, not hosting spaces every day for two years, but, you know, posting every day for two years and engaging.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, it's really what fuels us as we build in public is others who are building in public and there's no better platform for that than X and audio spaces.
[SPEAKER_05]: So.
[SPEAKER_05]: Great to have you guys aboard.
[SPEAKER_05]: Danielle will be be everyone else down below.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much for being here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Please make sure you like and repost the space and and it's those little things, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So for example, hat tip to Ben.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know he sent me a video message this morning and I really enjoyed that, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it's different.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not just a post.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not just something in the timeline, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's a theme showing up here in this conversation, which is making sure you're incorporating calls to action, but making sure you're sending those DMs, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Making sure you're wishing people happy birthday, like Patricia.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's these small things, they add up, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: When you have all these micro conversations, they add up.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is relationship building.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's hard to scale it, but it is possible.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it is definitely possible.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's jump over to Netta.
[SPEAKER_05]: Netta, good morning, good to see you.
[SPEAKER_05]: How are you doing?
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello, thank you for having me and hosting this lovely space as always.
[SPEAKER_11]: So what am I building in public?
[SPEAKER_11]: My portfolio for events, currently online and virtual.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's why you see me hosting so many spaces and live streams because I am trying to transition from release management
[SPEAKER_11]: to event program management.
[SPEAKER_11]: And very soon, there's going to be more exciting things coming my way and your way, everyone's way, because we're going to have more things coming up at Unfeathered.
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't speak for the hunt.
[SPEAKER_11]: which is another community I am a moderator in.
[SPEAKER_11]: But we'll see what surprises Sean has up his sleeve.
[SPEAKER_11]: But there are some exciting things coming in 2026.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I build because besides the building in public, it's something I truly enjoy, which is leveraging my current skill set to give back.
[SPEAKER_11]: uh, with my time and with my voice.
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wonderful sharing that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, great, great to hear the pivot and yeah, I think event management is, is kind of your next progression, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you're, you're so good at organizing communities and building communities and that's the next step is event management.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a nice progression.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, I know whatever you build will be great because you have great relationships, great connections, and you always do great work.
[SPEAKER_05]: So hat tip to you.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're great at project management.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that goes along with event management.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, I really appreciate you being here, Netta.
[SPEAKER_05]: And guys, if you're not following Netta, make sure you check out her Unfeathered community.
[SPEAKER_05]: She hosts spaces during the week and on the weekends.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's all about people who are building
[SPEAKER_05]: Mention everyone if you don't mind about your Saturday space because you know I'm enjoying them when I can pop in.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah we're shaking things up right now.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm trying to focus more on Feathered with my co-founder Justin Thomas.
[SPEAKER_11]: So the Saturday space is going to be either the hunt or it's going to be unfeathered.
[SPEAKER_11]: We are working on with our lovely volunteers on creating a website or a notion page or something where all the events are going to be centralized.
[SPEAKER_11]: But the events are the hunt where we help moderate conversations and bring an amazing panel of experts like yourself, Andy, and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_11]: uh to help people you know answer questions to help them with their career and their job search this is primarily the biggest audience that we have are some of the most hard-working and smart people they're from africa but we have a very wide audience so people who are even more senior in their career are learning a thing or two so
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't want to say it's going to be only on Saturdays.
[SPEAKER_11]: Things are shaking up over the next few weeks, but please give add a notification bell for my profile so you know when I'm hosting and unfeathered.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's in my spotlight.
[SPEAKER_11]: We have live streams on the career files.
[SPEAKER_11]: We have live streams for sharing the journey of women who are successful in their career.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we have other events as well.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we have spaces for founders and entrepreneurs as well.
[SPEAKER_11]: So stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_11]: Once again, I can't confirm everything 100%.
[SPEAKER_11]: We are changing a lot of stuff around, but it's
[SPEAKER_11]: focus mainly on value for the community.
[SPEAKER_11]: So just give a follow, stay tuned, and we'll share all the updates when they're official.
[SPEAKER_11]: But thank you so much for giving me some time to share.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, thank you, Netta.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just have a quick question for you, if you don't mind.
[SPEAKER_05]: So are you seeing, yeah, are you seeing a trend in like forced entrepreneurship?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a topic that's been on my mind, as you know, I've shared about it, but, you know, you're working closer, you know, more closely with other
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, communities and founders more regularly than myself.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause I just do the morning spaces on, you know, sales, marketing mastery bar.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you seeing a bit of a trend in like people?
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you seen an uptick in trend of people like being out of work, needing work, stuff like that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you seeing a trend?
[SPEAKER_11]: In Canada at least, things are not looking so good here.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm from Canada.
[SPEAKER_11]: The US, I can't speak about the US because I don't live there, but I think it's the same trend there.
[SPEAKER_11]: People are trying to make ends meet and they're looking for different ways.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_11]: So entrepreneurship is one of those.
[SPEAKER_11]: I do see it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Neda.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Guys, make sure you're following Neda, please.
[SPEAKER_05]: She's, you know, she was one of the first like hosts on, uh, you know, the hunt spaces that I got introduced to like two years ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you Neda for your consistency and dedication to this platform and to the craft.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, and thanks for being a Ronin, you know, you're, you're a Ronin.
[SPEAKER_05]: Once someone joins a Ronin, they're a Ronin, you know, so.
[SPEAKER_05]: Appreciate you and appreciate the support and really looking forward to, you know, ongoing collaborations with the feathered community.
[SPEAKER_05]: Community collaborations are great and and yeah, I really enjoyed that live stream with with the five of us or four of us.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sherilyn, myself, you, Justin and Andy.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, there's five of us and thanks for being here so.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, great, let's go over to Will.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's check in with Will and then we'll go to Wacar.
[SPEAKER_05]: Will, how's it going?
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_10]: Good morning, everyone.
[SPEAKER_10]: Good timing, Justin.
[SPEAKER_10]: I literally just finished my breakfast.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was listening to Netta going, yeah, this is really amazing, but I can't speak right now.
[SPEAKER_10]: So welcome to another beautiful day, everybody.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, we've already had a great space.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've got VB as a speaker as well.
[SPEAKER_10]: We had a great conversation this morning.
[SPEAKER_10]: And yeah, I just wanted to
[SPEAKER_10]: come on up and share what we're building in public.
[SPEAKER_10]: So this week, guys, as you know, I launched the tiers inside my school community.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we've had our first members join and the results are positive.
[SPEAKER_10]: People are liking it.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I wanted to just come up and say that, you know, a lot of the stuff I've learned from Justin is proving itself in performance, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: with the ideas that, as you've been saying, find out what people want, go and get it, and give it to them.
[SPEAKER_10]: It sounds so simple when we say it that way, but
[SPEAKER_10]: I probably would have spent more time trying to figure out what people wanted, trying to build something that I thought was amazing, but that didn't resonate with the people I was serving.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I just wanted to give a small testimonial to our Ronin Sensei and say that advice alone probably saved me several months of trial and error.
[SPEAKER_10]: So now I'm just consistently asking people, Hey, what do you want?
[SPEAKER_10]: How can I do this better for you?
[SPEAKER_10]: while it's still in line with my philosophy of as within, so without.
[SPEAKER_10]: And yeah, I've got to say, it's been a far more enjoyable journey doing it that way.
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah, that's my big building in public win for this last week.
[SPEAKER_10]: So tiers are officially launched.
[SPEAKER_10]: We have several paying members now in the community, and we've had some positive reviews.
So
[SPEAKER_10]: As we said many months ago, Justin, planting seeds that grow tall trees.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, now those tall trees are beginning to sprout and the job is to water them and make sure they're growing healthy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's exciting.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for that testimonial.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you'll have to rewind the space after this is over and listen to the beginning because I played
[SPEAKER_05]: the intro trailer with your voice.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's no accident.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, there's no accidents here, guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: So well, thank you all for that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And let me just comment a little bit on the the the watering of the plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the bamboo tree is a great analogy or metaphor.
[SPEAKER_05]: I get the two mixed up, but you get the where I'm going.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the bamboo tree
[SPEAKER_05]: it doesn't sprout for like seven years.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it takes seven years on average of consistent, you know, sunlight, water, you know, fill in the blank, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: And then after seven years, it grows like, you know, 10 or 20, 30 feet in that year.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the same applies to personal development and, you know, what we're building sometimes is like, we don't see the light at the end of the tunnel.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then all of a sudden,
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is why I also say you're really just one phone call away, one DM away, one connection away, one relationship away from your life potentially changing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's so true because just that one connection, you can get a huge account.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can sell a product.
[SPEAKER_05]: And myself and Will, we're in the people product business, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like other people have brands that they, and I talked to Andy about this yesterday a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, the Revenue Ronin is a brand, but it's like I don't have a product that I sell.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, maybe my AI tool, my fractional CMO AI tool, but essentially like I don't have a physical product that I sell, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: But the product here is people, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So when you love people, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I love people.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is why I love sales.
[SPEAKER_05]: Will is the same way.
[SPEAKER_05]: Andy's the same way.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're a people person, everyone on Spaces, typically they love people.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're in the right space, number one,
[SPEAKER_05]: And your product is people and transforming people, helping them bring in more revenue, helping them transform their identity.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, so when you dedicate to the product of people, right, great things will happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: And as long as they see value.
[SPEAKER_05]: And to Will's point, find out what people want, go and get it and give it to them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that continuous cycle, that feedback loop continues on and on, and it doesn't stop.
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't stop.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is how you build a sustainable business, a sustainable growing business.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Will's journey, he's shared with us very publicly.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's done different school communities in the past.
[SPEAKER_05]: It didn't really work out, but now he's,
[SPEAKER_05]: And I literally watched a video on this like, I think it was yesterday or the day before.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this guy was like a TikTok, one of these influencers on TikTok.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's like, it took him 13 products to hit it big, 13.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, it wasn't one, it wasn't two, it was 13.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he didn't hit until his 13th product, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So just don't stop.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just don't stop, just keep going.
[SPEAKER_05]: As me and Andy like to remind ourselves daily, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Just keep going, do the work, and do more.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, that's what it's all about.
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you, Will, for that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go for it, yeah, go for it.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I just had a little bit to add.
[SPEAKER_10]: Apologies, my Spaniel's just burst into the room.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hope she's quiet.
[SPEAKER_10]: What I wanted to add to that, right, about that 13, 14 failures, does anyone in the room know my friend Virgil, Virgil Brewster?
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm pretty sure you guys know him.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's on Spaces occasionally.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we were hanging out, I think it was towards the end of last year, and he was saying that he launched, I think, 30 products within the space of a year, and only 15 of them landed.
[SPEAKER_10]: And this guy's a multimillionaire, two-comma award winner,
[SPEAKER_10]: And he said to me, one thing that was really important, right, which was, you're never going to get it right the first time.
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you did, you wouldn't even know, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: This comes from many people, Bob Proctor, Napoleon Hill, all the greats have said the same thing, that failure is not the opposite of success.
[SPEAKER_10]: It is the prerequisite to success.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's my version of it.
[SPEAKER_10]: So when we look at it through that lens,
[SPEAKER_10]: What I viewed as a failure originally, you know, because my product for anyone who doesn't know me is I help people with an unshakable self-concept, that unshakable version of themselves.
[SPEAKER_10]: And my original community, which I think several of you guys were in, the Hero Academy, if you remember it, I made a mistake of making it about people I knew and liked, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: But it was about, I collected 130 people who all knew me, and yet nobody knew each other.
[SPEAKER_10]: No one was talking to each other.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'd failed to do the one promise of the community.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I looked at it that way for a minute, but then I realized, no, actually I up leveled myself in so many ways.
[SPEAKER_10]: I learned how to moderate and manage a group of people all towards the same objective.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we've said it many times, but it bears repeating that depending on how you look at it, something could be a loss or a lesson.
[SPEAKER_10]: Something can be a failure or a feedback.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it really does come down to how you're choosing to view it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Because the circumstance, and I'm gonna go, I won't go too deep in this, but the circumstances are never the cause.
[SPEAKER_10]: The circumstances are just the circumstances.
[SPEAKER_10]: They are neutral.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's how you determine them to be that determines how they will be to you.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's how you see them, it's how you interpret them, and that's what you make it mean.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so the beautiful thing about building, um, to your point, Justin, about doing what we do, which is, um, well, for me, it's an intangible ROI for you.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a very tangible ROI, but it's, it's working with a person.
[SPEAKER_10]: And effectively helping them bring out something or reduce something from themselves.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the beautiful part of that is that it is a process that we can get better at, even if we fail quote unquote on paper.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Because there's always a lesson to be learned.
[SPEAKER_10]: And the beautiful thing about working with people is you can just ask them, what would make this a 10 out of 10 for you?
[SPEAKER_10]: What would make this the perfect outcome for you?
[SPEAKER_10]: And they will tell you what they want.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is what I want.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then you just be very honest.
[SPEAKER_10]: Can I deliver that?
[SPEAKER_10]: State the facts, tell the truth.
[SPEAKER_10]: And all of a sudden they're helping you build the business.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's what I did differently this time around.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just asked guys, what would make this the best community for you?
[SPEAKER_10]: What would help you stay in that state of being the opera in power source every single day?
[SPEAKER_10]: And they told me and I just built it and now they like it.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's what I'm building in public.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's kind of the biggest lesson I've learned over the last year of doing it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's a pro tip right there that will highlight it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to share with everyone because make sure you take note of this.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is really important.
[SPEAKER_05]: So anytime you work with clients, you ask them,
[SPEAKER_05]: They're on a scale of zero to 10.
[SPEAKER_05]: What would you rate the level of my service?
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you ask them and you listen and you be quiet and you don't say anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't interrupt them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you let them speak.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then at the end of that, if it's not a 10 or higher, I've, I've, I've given people have given me twenties.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're like, Justin, this is a 20.
[SPEAKER_05]: So after that you say, okay, well, what would make it a 10?
[SPEAKER_05]: If it's not a 10.
[SPEAKER_05]: you ask the second question, you say, what would make this a 10?
[SPEAKER_05]: And you listen and you get the feedback.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a big pro tip.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't stress this enough.
[SPEAKER_05]: I use this.
[SPEAKER_05]: It works.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, and yeah, like you, you have to strive for greatness, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to strive for greatness.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like my favorite book, good to great by Jim Collins.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is my favorite book.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, and,
[SPEAKER_05]: This is where I get a lot of my principles in business and teaching, leadership, and a lot of things, is from Good to Great by Jim Collins, my favorite book.
[SPEAKER_05]: So to Will's point, just make sure you're asking your clients that you're working with, on a scale of zero to 10, what would you rate my level of service?
[SPEAKER_05]: And if it's not a 10, then you ask them, or higher, then you ask them, what would make this a 10 for you?
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's the gold right there, that's the gold.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't mean just one person,
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I mean like 30 people, however many people you've worked with.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is gold.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the other thing I want to point out is I just put it in the purple pill here, the Jumbotron.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I did, and this is a hat tip to Will, he'll love this, because I've been doing a deep dive, as I mentioned, on high performers and their personas.
[SPEAKER_05]: And VB, you'll love this one as well, because this is kind of your space.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, who do people have to become to become unstoppable, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's all about the identity upgrades for like Kobe Bryant, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: He was the Black Mamba.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, David Goggins, the hardest man alive, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Air Jordan, you know, Michael Jordan had to become Air Jordan, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So you'll see a pattern here.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it all stems from a lot of the work that Will's doing and teaching people.
[SPEAKER_05]: in the community about these personas and stepping into that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, and that's, again, the Revenue Ronin, the whole Batman effect, it's real, you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: So, but yeah, let's jump over to, I saw Danielle's hand go up, and then we'll go back to Will real quick, and then we'll go to VB and Wagar.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, go ahead, Danielle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know, I love that comment that you're saying about, you know, invite, you know, clients or prospects to weigh in and to evaluate their experience, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, on its face, that can seem a little bit uncomfortable, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's certainly a vulnerable position.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I love about that is not only the important feedback we get to curate our processes to improve them, but also to let people know that they matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's something very intimate about being invited in to weigh in like that, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think that that strengthens any relationship that's already existing.
[SPEAKER_01]: and certainly can help create one that is really just like on the outskirts, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because then they have skin in the game because they have participated in the process when they're evaluating.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great reminder and I thank you for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, of course, Daniel, and yeah, I mean, I'm going through it right now with this new client is, you know, I check in with them weekly, you know, to make sure like they're happy, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, you know, you want happy clients, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't want
[SPEAKER_05]: clients that are not happy.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, the reality is you uncover a lot more as you start consulting with clients.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's a dance, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: You're dancing here, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: You want to make sure you're on the same sheet of music here, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: You develop kind of a cadence and a dance.
[SPEAKER_05]: And as long as they're happy, right, you got to keep your clients happy.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you have to get that feedback.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to get that feedback.
[SPEAKER_05]: In my line of work, it takes 90 days to see significant revenue and income and results and transformation.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ninety days.
[SPEAKER_05]: My clients commit to 90 days.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the minimum.
[SPEAKER_05]: I won't take on any clients for less than 90 days.
[SPEAKER_05]: Why?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because marketing and sales take time.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't just launch one campaign in a week and make a million dollars, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, for a certain level of client, I can, but majority is 90 day sprints.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the way I work.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the way I function.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's the framework that I use.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's a systematic approach, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: I've created a system where I dropped the system in, I transformed their sales and marketing in 90 days or less, and then they get the result and they're happy.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, uh, but you have to check in along the way.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to have these checkpoints along the way, and really important.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, okay, let's go back over to Will, and then we'll go to VB and Wacar, and I'd love to hear from Riley.
[SPEAKER_05]: Riley's been an awesome friend online these last few months, so I'd love to hear from Riley.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, over to you, Will.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I just want to mirror that.
[SPEAKER_10]: I saw Riley's YouTube videos pop up in the wild the other day, which was amazing.
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah, I mean, to Danielle's point,
[SPEAKER_10]: The way that I'm starting to view things here is, and again, for anyone who doesn't know me, I came from 20 years corporate sales, right, manager in a bank for mortgages.
[SPEAKER_10]: So my experience in coaching and leading people was very much from a results-driven perspective, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: We wanted conversion rates, we wanted leads to conversions, and all the other great metrics that you would look at.
[SPEAKER_10]: However, what I learned along the way
[SPEAKER_10]: is that somebody's self-concept, somebody's identity is the ceiling and floor of what they will allow themselves to create.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's more often than, and to your point, Justin, about the identity and the Batman effect, by putting on a persona or a mask,
[SPEAKER_10]: you are effectively able to play by different rules.
[SPEAKER_10]: However, the authenticity and the authentic self will always reemerge as soon as the awareness is taken away.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is why you can't fake confidence for long.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is why you can't fake being yourself for long.
[SPEAKER_10]: It will always find a way out because the subconscious does not lie.
[SPEAKER_10]: As soon as the mind is away from the present moments, which it spends 95 to 97% of the time not present, those deep-seated beliefs will always emerge.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so helping people with the subconscious identity is the single highest leverage point to changing the physical tangible results.
[SPEAKER_10]: Cause that's where people want to start, but that's like step four in the chain.
[SPEAKER_10]: It starts with identity, which then influences your thoughts, which influences your feelings and actions, which produces your results.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then you look at the results and say, oh, that's who I am.
[SPEAKER_10]: No, you are the version of you that you decide to be.
[SPEAKER_10]: The problem is, can you contain that?
[SPEAKER_10]: Can you maintain that?
[SPEAKER_10]: And the thing I wanted to speak to very briefly, Justin, was the 90 days and the value in that window, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of people say that, you know, changing a habit takes 21 to 90 days.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I disagree.
[SPEAKER_10]: Changing a habit is instant.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not familiar.
[SPEAKER_10]: You haven't patented it.
[SPEAKER_10]: You have momentum in the other direction, but you change the moment you decide to change.
[SPEAKER_10]: The thing that you need to patent and condition is not going back to the old self.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's being loyal.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you guys know, I like to quote scripture.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's being loyal, being faithful to that new self.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the part that's hard.
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyone can be confident for two minutes, but then they'll go back.
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyone can adopt the state of being wealthy for two minutes when things are going smoothly.
[SPEAKER_10]: But as soon as the bill hits, they go back.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the hard part.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's what I've really learned over the years is the part that people need the help with.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I would never have found that out if I wasn't in going out, speaking to people, asking them what was difficult about change.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I've got to give a hat tip to Jason Barrett.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think I can see growth stacks in the space, but if Jason's here, um, Jason was really good at this.
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, he told me that we, um, I had a call with him last year and he said he was going out to like 300 people and just asking them what their problems were.
[SPEAKER_10]: And this is what I modeled.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I was like, well, okay, let me just speak to as many people as I can.
[SPEAKER_10]: I did it for free on spaces, free coaching sessions with will.
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, if you remember me and that did that for about a year and it was like, well, tell me what your problems are.
[SPEAKER_10]: And what I learned over the year was.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's easy to be the version of you until you take your foot off the gas.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then you go right back to who you believe you are, but that's the limit, the ceiling and the floor and the results you'll allow yourself to produce.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so changing that to an internal focus really is the highest leverage point.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that takes about 90 days, give or take.
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah, I just wanted to speak on that time window because that's pretty universal in terms of a complete transformation.
[SPEAKER_10]: So thank you, Justin.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, thank you, Will.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if I understand you correctly,
[SPEAKER_05]: The decision is immediate, but the lasting effects are, you know, 30, 60, 90 days, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that accurate?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I mean, think about this, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's say somebody decides they want to be fit.
[SPEAKER_10]: They've been out of shape for years, and they make that snap decision.
[SPEAKER_10]: They had their FTE, and they're like, I am now going to the gym, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: They're an unfit person, both within and without.
[SPEAKER_10]: So what they do is they can decide I am now a fit person.
[SPEAKER_10]: And for the moment, their awareness is on it.
[SPEAKER_10]: They are until they go back until they take their awareness off it until it's raining outside.
[SPEAKER_10]: And now they don't want to go to the gym until they're sick of eating the healthy food and they craving that old stuff.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: They were, their attention was on being a healthy person.
[SPEAKER_10]: But it must be persisted.
[SPEAKER_10]: And Neville Goddard was huge on this.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you guys know I love Neville.
[SPEAKER_10]: Persist in the state of the wish fulfilled.
[SPEAKER_10]: And his version was very spiritual metaphysical.
[SPEAKER_10]: It will harden into fact.
[SPEAKER_10]: My version is very psychological.
[SPEAKER_10]: Your self-image will update and your actions are always congruent with your self-image.
[SPEAKER_10]: So the goal is not to try and get somewhere.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is where 99% of people go wrong.
[SPEAKER_10]: They'll spend the first 90 days of that process saying, I'm not good enough.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not good enough.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not good enough.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then maybe when I'll get to 90 days, I'll be good enough.
[SPEAKER_10]: You spend 90 days telling yourself you're not it.
[SPEAKER_10]: How are you ever going to become it?
[SPEAKER_10]: The goal is day one, this is who I am now, this is who I am now.
[SPEAKER_10]: And the goal of the practice is to maintain that.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you are literally training the brain, the identity that is the lens you see reality through, who you are.
[SPEAKER_10]: So rather than being not it and waiting for some magical number to get there,
[SPEAKER_10]: You flip the script.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is what Alan Carr did to help people stop smoking, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: VB and I have talked about this.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not, I'm trying to quit smoking for 90 days.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's, I am not a smoker day one.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I repeat that for 90 days until it's who I am.
[SPEAKER_10]: As within, so without it really is universally applicable, but yeah, I think 90 days from my experience, right.
[SPEAKER_10]: From what I've observed, from what I've gone through myself, I'm not sure if you guys remember when I lost a bunch of weight, but like.
[SPEAKER_10]: to stick with that when it was hard, but I said, I am now an athlete, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: I was 130 kilos for American people.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was like 300 pounds.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was a big guy and I'm six two.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I wear it well, but I was unhealthy.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I was like, I am now an athlete.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I train and I eat cleanly and it sucked, but I could stick to it because that's who I was.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I was reinforcing the identity with every day of congruent action.
[SPEAKER_10]: So rather than trying to convince myself based on the external results that I am now an athlete, it's like, no, I am this and my actions prove it.
[SPEAKER_08]: By the way, eating healthy doesn't suck.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just the way it is for healthy people.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's delightful.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's lovely.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the by the way, everybody's got to play until they get punched in the face.
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly right.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that was I think that was from
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it was from Mike Tyson, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: And I mean, everybody said it a different way, but I love the way he said it because who wants to get punched in the face from Mike Tyson?
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, like nobody said ever.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nobody ever said, yeah, let me go ahead and I'll sign up for that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm a martial artist.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, not doing that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I love the way Will said it.
[SPEAKER_08]: The most important thing is that,
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, hey, Andy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Would you mind if Riley went?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because he only has one minute.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I'll come back.
[SPEAKER_05]: Message me.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK. OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks, Andy.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK. Riley, over to you, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you guys hear me well?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're good, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good to see you, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry for the hijack, but I literally have 60 seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll try to come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's what I want to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember who talked before Will, but I want to dive back into that with measuring the success after 90 days and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give you two keys that you can take and don't hesitate to DM me if you want more information.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here's all the things that I do with my consulting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I do with international consulting with multi-million, sometimes billion-dollar companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing is I do take notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called the NPS survey, Net Promoter Score.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's essentially like a one question that you can ask around the satisfaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can use it multiple times.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is good is you can use it after...
[SPEAKER_00]: after onboarding your clients, about a week or a month, and then after the 90 days, or, and right before you send the invoice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, NPS, Net Promoter Score.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't know what it is or don't know how to use that, send me a DM, I'll send you the template that I'm using.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can dive into this framework and add a couple of extra questions to see how you can extract even better features with your clients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So start with the NPS.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the second thing that you can do in parallel with what Justin and Will said is use a framework called OKRs, Objectives and Key Results.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cool thing about that is that it's going to give you clarity and a clear focus on what you have to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the OKR methodology, there are three types of actions.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are inputs, there are outputs, and there are outcomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you're dealing with a customer, sometimes you cannot guarantee the output.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you're a fitness coach, you cannot guarantee that your client is going to lose weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: because a portion of the results is on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what you can guarantee is the input, what you do, the means that you put in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so OKRs will help you because it will force you to think in those three things, inputs, outputs, outcomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Input is what you do, the reps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Output is potential results of the reps, and outcome is the results of the results, something you can capitalize on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you blend OQRs, inputs, outputs, outcomes, and then an NPS to measure, you have something really, really powerful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to drop, but if you have any questions, send me a DM, and I'll see if I can come back in this conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: See you guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, thanks, Riley, for dropping the alpha here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Appreciate it, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, guys, let's go back over to Andy.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, that was some good alpha there.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, go ahead, Andy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, two things.
[SPEAKER_08]: First, thanks, Riley.
[SPEAKER_08]: The two things Will said, first, that everybody has a plan until it's not convenient.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I always look at that like getting punched in the face.
[SPEAKER_08]: But here's the other way to look at it.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you decide to do something, right, you decide to lose weight, you decide to get into shape, you decide to do whatever,
[SPEAKER_08]: Think of it this way, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: If you, back in school, if you decided to join a team, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: You're going to join the football team, you're going to join the cheer team, you're going to join the band, whatever.
[SPEAKER_08]: The moment, the first practice, and they go, you're on the team.
[SPEAKER_08]: Guess what?
[SPEAKER_08]: From that moment on, you are in the band.
[SPEAKER_08]: You are on the team.
[SPEAKER_08]: You are a team member.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's the day it changes.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the rest of it is the transformation of you becoming a better version of whatever it is you were, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: A better soccer player, a better football player, a better baseball player, a better whatever band, a better leader.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you just think of joining a team, and I have jerseys from teams because I like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I love athletics.
[SPEAKER_08]: I love competition, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: You want to go head to head.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm all in.
[SPEAKER_08]: But see, life isn't about competition because most times competition is a defined, constrained set of rules like this.
[SPEAKER_08]: my favorite guy Hermosi says, it has a beginning and an end.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's got boundaries.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's got rules.
[SPEAKER_08]: Guess what?
[SPEAKER_08]: Life and business don't have very many rules.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like number one, don't die.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Number two, if you screw up, you get another chance.
[SPEAKER_08]: If the sun, if you wake up today and there's a sunrise, you have another shot at it and you can decide today that you're on the
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, team black t-shirt and wear a black t-shirt and go for it.
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't have to, there's no permission.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nobody chooses that you're on or off the entrepreneur team.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nobody decides if you're good or bad, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: The only thing is if you choose to take the action and if people buy your stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: Entrepreneur, is that it?
[SPEAKER_08]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_08]: You decide to make the offer and people buy it.
[SPEAKER_08]: If they buy it, you're an entrepreneur.
[SPEAKER_08]: If they don't buy it, you haven't talked to enough people.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you talk to enough people, somebody will buy it, and then you're on the team entrepreneur.
[SPEAKER_08]: It is really that simple, but it's also that difficult.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have no idea how many people you have to talk to.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have no idea how many times you have to make an offer.
[SPEAKER_08]: I personally have started 14 different, or 13.
[SPEAKER_08]: 13 businesses and they all failed until number 14, where it succeeded.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I have literally made millions of dollars over the last couple of decades.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the next one I've tried, this is my fourth different perspective
[SPEAKER_08]: Things to do if you guys have watched I posted a thing on X that said hey look here's my video And here's a stupid screenshot of a video.
[SPEAKER_08]: I did a year ago, and then here's my video screenshots today And all I did was change like three things.
[SPEAKER_08]: I got a hundred dollar web camera I got a couple lights, and I got a stick light in the back and
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's the difference, that video.
[SPEAKER_08]: But that's the iteration.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm doing videos.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm on X. I'm delivering.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm selling.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm providing something.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I've had people buy stuff along the way.
[SPEAKER_08]: Not as many as I want yet, but they do, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: They come, they show up, they do, they offer, they buy, and it works.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just how much does it work for you?
[SPEAKER_08]: All you have to do is decide.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then
[SPEAKER_08]: If you decide to join the team, like join the Ronin team, it's, you know, 20 bucks, whatever it is to you.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if that's a little or a lot.
[SPEAKER_08]: But if you join the team, decide to join the team and do what they say.
[SPEAKER_08]: You will succeed at becoming a soccer player if you go out for the team and they choose you and then you get to go to practice and you practice and practice, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: You become a better footballer, a better soccer player.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's inevitable if you practice.
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, sorry, I'm going down the rabbit hole, but thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, no, thank you, Andy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I I highlighted a couple of things that came to mind based on your share.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the first thing is like you got to live up to your track record, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: You got to live up to your track record.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, typically before I work with clients and I'm sure you guys experience this as well, it's like they want to know, OK, what's your track record?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, what have you done in the past?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, what are the success stories?
[SPEAKER_05]: What are the case studies?
[SPEAKER_05]: What are, you know, who can I call to verify, like, you are who you say you are and you've done the work and you've, you know, brought in more revenue, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: And because people do their own due diligence.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so you got to be able to, you know, and this is a hard truth here for everyone.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is really important.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're only as good as your last sale and you're only as good as your last marketing campaign.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, let me repeat that.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're only as good as your last sale, and you're only as good as your last marketing campaign.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you may have work to do, myself included.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm calling myself out here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because what worked in the past doesn't necessarily work today.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so you have to continuously, this is why it's sales and marketing mastery.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because things are iterating at a very quick speed and thanks to AI now.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the reality is like, yes, you have your track record and that's great.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the reality is the person, the client that you're selling today, you're going to need to perform.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to need to step into the court and deliver.
[SPEAKER_05]: And just remember that because, you know, your credibility is on the line and everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, you know, that's just the reality, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: I wish I could sugarcoat it for you guys, but you know, I'm not, that's not my style, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So the reality is you gotta, once you sign that client, once you make that sale, you gotta deliver, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: You gotta fulfill.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yes, you have your track record to lean on, but ultimately it's a fresh slate, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a fresh start.
[SPEAKER_05]: So just make sure that you're delivering those results that you promise.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's it, I'll leave it there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, let's get to VB, and then we'll go to Fabio.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry for the time here, VB, but yeah, go for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Over to you, how's it going?
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Justin.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was quite a wait, but it was informative.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for the space.
[SPEAKER_06]: Once again, informative as usual.
[SPEAKER_06]: Great knowledge.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a little bit low on energy because it's the end of the day for me.
[SPEAKER_06]: So don't mind that.
[SPEAKER_06]: But a couple things.
[SPEAKER_06]: Firstly, you spoke about a book by Jim Collins.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I know what the book's name is, if you don't mind?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Good to Great by Jim Collins.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: My favorite book.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll check it out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, next.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's nice to see
[SPEAKER_06]: and listen to Will's journey, by the way, because he talks about his past and his learnings and what mistakes he made, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's quite encouraging, not just for me to hear, for anybody who follows him and anybody else to hear, because we tend to mistake or we tend to assume people
[SPEAKER_06]: in their current state, like, for example, if anybody looks at Justin right now, we think that you have achieved success right away, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: You achieved overnight success, but then you've been putting in the work for like 15, 20 years.
[SPEAKER_06]: Your YouTube videos the other day, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: You played it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, there are people who will be coming here and think that, man, how does Justin have it?
[SPEAKER_06]: How does Will have it?
[SPEAKER_06]: How does Andy do it, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: One thing to keep in mind that these guys have been doing it for the past 15, 20 years.
[SPEAKER_06]: Will has 20 years of corporate experience.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's been learning from his failures.
[SPEAKER_06]: So has Justin.
[SPEAKER_06]: So has everybody else.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not an overnight success.
[SPEAKER_06]: These guys have put in the work for the past 15, 20 years and have built the identity over a period of time of becoming this person that they are.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's nice to know and nice to hear from you all.
[SPEAKER_06]: You spoke about this bamboo tree kind of reference, Justin, and I think about that a lot because, especially after I finished Atomic Habits quite a while ago, but there's one reference that always sticks to me from that is there's an ice cube that is kept in a room.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just going to talk about it, by the way.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's an ice cube that's kept in a room.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's 25 degrees Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_06]: The ice is on the table, it doesn't melt.
[SPEAKER_06]: It becomes 26, it doesn't melt.
[SPEAKER_06]: 27, 28, 29, 30, it still doesn't melt.
[SPEAKER_06]: 31, doesn't melt.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then 32 degrees, then it slowly starts to melt, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: when it starts melting that's when we we tend to assume that okay it's that change between 31 to 32 that's making it melt but no it's actually the work that has been done between 25 degrees to 32 degrees that is making it melt right so and that's how personal branding and that's how consistency and that's how everything in my opinion works is
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to put in those initial reps where there's absolute silence.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobody is there to watch.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobody is giving you any kind of applauses.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobody doesn't know you exist.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's hard because I've been there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm still relatively a small creator now that I'm joining you guys on regular spaces.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's fun to network with you all, but
[SPEAKER_06]: If I didn't have a startup community and when I took my break off my marriage and then came back, I wouldn't have the network that I had.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wouldn't have the startup community as well as the revenue driven community.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: If I didn't meet you guys over Spaces.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm glad that I met you all in Spaces a year ago, which has given me this, you know, I came back and I'm back in Spaces once again.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So thanks for that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And guys, there's no applause in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to push through all the way.
[SPEAKER_06]: That.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now in terms of people, you guys are people, people, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: You talk about how you enjoy people.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm kind of the opposite.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to say that I enjoy the right kind of people.
[SPEAKER_06]: The right kind of people you can find in spaces like this, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: You're surrounded by the right kind of people, information all around.
[SPEAKER_06]: um knowledge all around if you are the smartest person in the room they say that you're in the wrong room and i'm definitely not the smartest person in this room i can tell you that multiple people with experiences multiple people with self-experimentation and of course results over here definitely i love to be in this room why i'm not the smartest i learn every single minute that i spend in this room however
[SPEAKER_06]: People, on the other hand, not every kind of people are my favorites.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the very reasons I quit my job is because I felt that I was the smartest person in that room, is because I felt that the people around me were always waiting for the weekends, were always waiting to slack off, were addicted to mediocrity that they didn't even realize that they were mediocre.
[SPEAKER_06]: You are the sum average of the five people you surround yourself with.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is true.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very true.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that is one quote that I live by.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is one of the reasons I quit my job, of course.
[SPEAKER_06]: The other reason is entrepreneurship, my future life, freedom, all that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yes, I'm not particularly a people person, but I'm particularly a right kind of people person.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me put it that way.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I must tell you, everybody, listeners out there, this is the right room you're in.
[SPEAKER_06]: Try to tune in to Justin Space whenever you can.
[SPEAKER_06]: That.
[SPEAKER_06]: One final thing that I would like to add.
[SPEAKER_06]: What am I building in public?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I mean, you guys know this.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm building a product, but alongside the product, I've made a change.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now I'm going sales first, but the product basically I'm building in public.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the concept is idea to income.
[SPEAKER_06]: People over here, everybody has access to unlimited information.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody has access to equal and unlimited information, but do they put it to use?
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I'm trying to bridge that gap between idea or information to income.
[SPEAKER_06]: and by creating a product about it, how you can literally take your information from your head and turn it into income.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the product that I'm creating.
[SPEAKER_06]: But of course, you know that I've pivoted to sales first as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I've landed in two clients, day before yesterday, two days, now we are in day three.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm a little fortunate for that.
[SPEAKER_06]: The reason this is happening is because I've been building in public for the past 90 days.
[SPEAKER_06]: and they've seen my growth happen.
[SPEAKER_06]: One tip that I would like to put in here is I've started doing something I think 20 days ago where I started when I was in day 60, day 50 something.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just, every day morning I put in one post, mandatory.
[SPEAKER_06]: Today is day 70 and these are my tasks for the day.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I started doing this I think from day 50 onwards.
[SPEAKER_06]: On the first day when I started doing this, not much engagement, not much encouragement, but today I must tell you guys people are following that journey and it's actually working out.
[SPEAKER_06]: People want to know if I'm actually following through with what I'm saying and I want to follow through with what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_06]: You put it in public that you're going to do this, you're going to achieve XYZ in public and make it a point to achieve it because if you don't then
[SPEAKER_06]: you're going to lose some kind of a little bit of reputation, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: When you put your reputation on the line, you have to do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm putting myself on the line right there every morning.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty much it.
[SPEAKER_06]: One final thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, I'm hogging up the space.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if I want to leave, if I have to leave you all with one thing, I would say
[SPEAKER_06]: that we have to consider how precious little time we have to produce something extraordinary in our careers.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that is why it becomes imperative that we recycle the knowledge that we have back into a system where it can be useful, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: have their own experiences and observations.
[SPEAKER_06]: People learn lessons gleaned from success and failures and the ideas of others, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So if there is a secret to creativity, my friends, it is that it emerges from everyday efforts to gather and organize our daily influences.
[SPEAKER_06]: And today's age, in today's age, our daily influences
[SPEAKER_06]: are close to, and forgive my language, are close to crap.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because every single time we are close to being bored, we pull out our phones and start scrolling.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what do we scroll?
[SPEAKER_06]: We are not just scrolling to entertain ourselves.
[SPEAKER_06]: We are scrolling and we're consuming information and that information is going into your head.
[SPEAKER_06]: And now you have no space to imagine the kind of future you want to build for yourself.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have no space to think, imagine, and create.
[SPEAKER_06]: Stop scrolling, spend time being bored, and just consider how precious your life is, number one.
[SPEAKER_06]: And number two is how precious little time in a day that you have to produce something extraordinary.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd like to leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so much, Justin.
[SPEAKER_05]: Man, Vivi, wow, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Stop scrolling and start building, that's it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I appreciate the kind words, Vivi, really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yes, a couple of points that resonated with me.
[SPEAKER_05]: So your biggest competitor is who you were yesterday.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't ever forget that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Your biggest competitor is who you were yesterday.
[SPEAKER_05]: And look, A players wanna work with A players, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: When you present your offer to a prospect, when you present your,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, solution to people and people want to work with A players, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Why would they want to work with a B player, a C player, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you have to, and it starts with you, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything starts with you.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, and what makes it easier is surrounding yourself like people in this room.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are high performers here.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys are high performers, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to associate with other high performers, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just the natural progression here.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, the other point you made, VB, that's really important.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me pull up my notes here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, so sloppy success is better than perfect mediocrity.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, there's a lot of mediocrity and mediocrity in the world, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: There's tons, you can find it everywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: But don't forget that sloppy success is better than perfect mediocrity.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a quote that one of my mentors and former clients, Alex Mendoza and big internet marketer, he shared that with me and it stuck with me.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, like sloppy success is better than perfect mediocrity.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll take it all day.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you don't hear about,
[SPEAKER_05]: the 10 years that Hermosi put in to get to that $100 million launch, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: He put in like 10 years.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it can be a lonely journey, but as VB said, you're in the right room here.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I wanna acknowledge you, VB, because look, there's a lot of people who get laid off, but you actually quit your job at LinkedIn.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's something to be said about that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, there's something to be said about that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that to me,
[SPEAKER_05]: signifies that you're a very serious person.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're someone to be taken very serious.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know exactly who you are and where you're going.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's incredibly powerful.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I applaud you for that, VB, for taking that step and continuing to be building here, showing up, doing the work.
[SPEAKER_05]: I acknowledge you and just keep it up, brother.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just keep it up.
[SPEAKER_05]: So thanks for being here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for the contribution today.
[SPEAKER_05]: Always, always gems.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, and yeah, thanks.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't believe it's been a year that I've known you, but, uh, yeah, it's, it's been a great journey.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, all right, let's go over to Fabio.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got about, uh, seven minutes left here or, or, or some change.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like seven minutes.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, um, I want to get to final words.
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's go over to Fabio for a minute and then whack car, and then we're going to do final word here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks Fabio.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just keep it to like a minute if you can, brother.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, Justin, thank you for having me over.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll be quick.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi to everyone.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I want to answer the what and why am I building in public and like a very long story short.
[SPEAKER_12]: I came, my professional background is in negotiation and mediation and I worked in this for over seven years and
[SPEAKER_12]: I decided that I wanted to experiment online.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that building a digital presence is the future.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so I started building.
[SPEAKER_12]: And Justin and a few other faces here, Timo as well, we've connected, I think, more than two years ago already.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I was doing spaces.
[SPEAKER_12]: But then I realized that I didn't have
[SPEAKER_12]: Many digital skills, let's put it that way.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I took a break, a nine month break.
[SPEAKER_12]: And today I work with ghostwriting.
[SPEAKER_12]: But I'm also going back to something that I used to do and I think I do very well, which is doing spaces, yes, but more than doing spaces, I'm building a mastermind community as well.
[SPEAKER_12]: And don't take me wrong, Justin, by no means the intention is to compete.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that, if anything, you have already built a strong community with strong membership and you bring the insights from all the work that you have, all the experience that you have.
[SPEAKER_12]: My experience is in facilitation and Socratic seminar.
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's kind of what I'm building with the mastermind idea.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's very incipient.
[SPEAKER_12]: I have spoken with a few people already and I'm really excited and eager to have the first go.
[SPEAKER_12]: But the idea is to help people really take the next step, get actionable insights, and have a frequent conversation that's going to help push them forward and push them upwards.
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's the idea.
[SPEAKER_12]: I just want to thank Justin.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for having me here.
[SPEAKER_12]: And again, for giving me the space.
[SPEAKER_12]: And yeah, I appreciate all of you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, thank you Fabio.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, exciting to hear what you're building in.
[SPEAKER_05]: The just just like brands mature right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Our business models mature.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know we we need to adapt.
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to play to our strengths and so yeah, what you shared really resonate really resonate with me Fabio.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, I'm happy to support what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you've been a long friend on here two years now so.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, it's so good to still be connected to you, of course.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, and yeah, man, um, just keep showing up and continue having the conversations and, you know, with the right people at the right time.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what marketing essentially is all about.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's communicating with people at the right time on the right platform, on the right channel.
[SPEAKER_05]: With the right message the right audience all those things have to line up and then that gets to that 3% rule of people who are ready to buy so But yeah, thank you Fabio great to have you and yeah, like I encourage anyone to build community, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I'm an open book as you know, you know build your own community Like that's part of the 10 C's framework that I teach right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So it starts with caring first Sorry starts with commitment first and then you got to care and then it's community
[SPEAKER_05]: context to that community, communications, content creation, consistency, conversion, cash.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are the 10 C's.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you follow that 10 C's framework.
[SPEAKER_05]: It used to be seven, but I added three more C's.
[SPEAKER_05]: Why?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because everything starts with commitment and you got to care.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then everything else flows from there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the last one is cash, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got, it's got to equal cash at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like if it's not bringing in revenue, like you, you got work to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got, you got work to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so you need to validate it and ideally pre-sell it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's easier said than done, but yeah, I encourage everyone to build a community around their products and services and their brand, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the new, that's how you sell and build something lasting in this digital age.
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you again, Fabio.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go over to, let's see if we can get Wacar up here real quickly, cause we only got a couple minutes left here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, but yeah, if you can keep it to like a minute or two, Wacar, hopefully it connects.
[SPEAKER_05]: If not, we'll have to get you on the next one here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, Wacar, are you there?
[SPEAKER_05]: Wacar, are you there?
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I'm not sure we can, Wackar, it says you're a speaker, so yeah, feel free to go ahead and come off mic if you're available.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I hope everyone is doing great and having an amazing day.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, yeah, it keeps dropping you down.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's weird.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, Wackar.
[SPEAKER_05]: Please come tomorrow if you don't mind.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll be here in the Startup Circle community.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'd love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for being here.
[SPEAKER_05]: spaces isn't working right now for you but yeah let's go over to Timo here for final word and then we'll go to Andy and then I'll close this out so thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah great space as always unfortunately had stuff to do and couldn't get from the very beginning but a lot of good
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of good topics were discussed, and just quickly, what am I building?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm building a brand that now is more and more aligned with building a business with newsletter ecosystems and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Email is not dead yet, as you might have noticed from the post that I did in the morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I can say that, well, pleasurable space, a lot of knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully people had no taking apps on the go.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, not much to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go to Andy and let you build your castles.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it's a beautiful day.
