[SPEAKER_07]: So, but yeah, great to have you guys aboard.
[SPEAKER_07]: Happy Saturday.
[SPEAKER_07]: Good to see you job father.
[SPEAKER_07]: Good to see you, Justin.
[SPEAKER_07]: Always a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Jason, Avni, Christelle.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Andy's here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Gotta get him up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh-oh.
[SPEAKER_07]: Andy's here.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that was a great space.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yesterday, I was listening to the replay, Andy, of the space with you and Jim in the Startup Circle at 12.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that was a great one.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Endless is here, and Kyle, and yeah, many others.
[SPEAKER_07]: So thanks, guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, I want to share with you guys, I don't know if you guys have been paying attention to the content that I've been doing this month in October, but I want to share with you a little bit about that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's been getting great results.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I've done a few different things this month for October, and the metrics are just off the charts.
[SPEAKER_07]: So now it's time to correlate that to revenue, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Revenue.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, but everything's a progression, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Everything's a progression.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't, you can't expect the only way you're going to get the revenue to tie in with all the impressions, all the engagement, all the comments, all the likes, all that stuff is you got to follow up.
[SPEAKER_07]: You got to follow up.
[SPEAKER_07]: What do I mean by that?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, if you see that people are liking your stuff and they're commenting, you got to follow up in the DMs.
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to, like you, you have to, you have to chase business.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right, if you just think you're just gonna post and ghost and just business is gonna come flooding into your inbox, you got another thing coming.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm telling you right now, that's not realistic.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a bonus.
[SPEAKER_07]: If that happens, that's a freaking bonus.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, but the reality is, I mean, literally I've worked with people who have gotten 8 million views and zero revenue in like six months.
[SPEAKER_07]: They have a combined of 8 million views,
[SPEAKER_07]: and they got zero revenue.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now this was after I started working with them.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me point that out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because they were not working with me and getting eight million views and zero revenue.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me tell you, that would not have been a good thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: So for October, and then we'll go to Kevin and Andy, for October, this is exactly what I've been doing.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I've been recording Zoom videos,
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been taking the transcripts, and I've been trying to do one a day, right, one a day in October.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I go to Claude, and then I basically have a custom prompt that I've written, and I push it out to 14 different channels, you know, all the content, mostly LinkedIn, X, YouTube.
[SPEAKER_07]: are like my primaries, and then my blog and stuff like that, newsletter, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm really trying to X and LinkedIn.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the metrics have been incredible.
[SPEAKER_07]: And sometimes I'm posting twice a day, three times a day to LinkedIn, and the metrics are incredible.
[SPEAKER_07]: So now I'm following up with some of the people who have been liking my stuff, commenting, engaging.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, I saw that you liked my post, really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_07]: What got you interested in the topic specifically?
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you having any challenges right now with marketing?
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I conduct a free marketing audit for you?
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the progression.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, but the numbers are having great, like it's been a huge explosion of impressions and engagement and likes.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so now I'm following up in the DMS on LinkedIn and, and X.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, uh, so yeah, over to you, Kevin.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: The very interesting story, Justin, you said eight or eight or 80 million views.
[SPEAKER_06]: Either way, not being able to convert any revenue from that, I feel like you have to really try to not make revenue from anything like that too.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I say this to people all the time.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Justin, you've heard me say this a lot, but it's so true.
[SPEAKER_06]: Even at this stage in the game where people assume I have a following, I have a little bit of attention that the clients would be coming to me.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yes, it's a bonus when they do come to me because they see my page.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pretty much like a resume.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you use that resume as a sort of testimonial after you do that outreach as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's how you should really go about it in that sense as well, because they're not going to come to you.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this day I'm sending out oftentimes, I think just the other day I sent out 400 DMs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Justin, I'm not kidding.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ended up sending over 400 DMs, ended up having 30 leads because of it as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: So even just what is that, 1%?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's about like 5%.
[SPEAKER_06]: even there too so it is a numbers game you have to be going out there as well the most successful people if you're if you're a stock broker as well right good example there people are going out to get that money at the end of the day too so really really just um take it seriously because yeah and especially in this day and age right everybody's trying to get attention
[SPEAKER_06]: That's one thing, but not everybody is trying to convert.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you're looking to win this game, you have to be going out there and trying to actually convert those leads because it's a very, very different game as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's why sales is so, so important.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, yeah, those numbers, Kevin, that's a lot of outreach and yeah, that's what it takes now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, and, and you tell me if this is realistic, Kevin, cause you know better than anyone.
[SPEAKER_07]: So last year compared to this year, would you say that you're having to do much more outreach in the DMs and newsletter versus last year to get leads?
[SPEAKER_06]: Definitely not.
[SPEAKER_06]: No.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this ultimately comes from having the leverage and the asset of have built a newsletter as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: Things do get easier because you're building that while you're building your brand, you're building
[SPEAKER_06]: authority with your newsletters.
[SPEAKER_06]: And even if you're just building here on X and you grow to a very solid following, having that as a testimonial in and of itself really does work because it doesn't take as much convincing from a sales and marketing perspective, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because people, they are, you know, trust is number one, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: You need to be able to have people who trust you.
[SPEAKER_06]: And in my niche, which is premium ghostwriting and brand building, one of the key things that people are looking for
[SPEAKER_06]: is the size and the numbers and the engagements that we're getting because they know if I'm able to do it that they want some of that you know they want piece of that pie as well and I've been able to grow you know quite a bit in a year about 30,000 followers as well and I use that as a testimonial as well so it definitely takes a lot less convincing and that is to also add on the fact that
[SPEAKER_06]: The market is becoming more and more saturated only in the sense that people are becoming more competitive.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you're able to outspeed all of that, then it's not really going to matter.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if I understand correctly here, and correct me if I'm wrong, but
[SPEAKER_07]: It takes more, not necessarily more convincing, but it takes more touch points and outreach to get meetings.
[SPEAKER_06]: Less convincing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm saying, do I say more?
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: It takes less convincing than let's say to a year ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: But is your volume increased?
[SPEAKER_07]: Right?
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's say you had to do 400 a day last year.
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you still doing 400 a day this year to get the same number?
[SPEAKER_07]: or are you doing more outreach or less outreach?
[SPEAKER_06]: Honestly, I've just been doing the same because I'm looking to build.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have some people on my team working in the back and I got my brothers.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've employed my brothers as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's been about the same only from the building side of things.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm still building the fundamentals.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would say it's honestly been around the same as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's good to know.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, because
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I would say from my standpoint, like I've had to do way more outreach and touch points than I did last year to get meetings booked and get appointments and get clients.
[SPEAKER_07]: And why would you say that is?
[SPEAKER_07]: Just because people are busier, you know, people are busier and, you know, they're more distracted and they just have more going on or, or it's a combination of my content and my outbound messages aren't good enough.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not getting the reactions and the outcomes that I got last year.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and that's totally fair, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: And I mean, if we're building on X, X is changing so, so much too.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, I'm in the same boat.
[SPEAKER_06]: It hasn't really changed much.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe reaching out 10% more, nothing too significant.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some people are increasing that volume up towards 30% annually on average.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, as big as Alex Hormozy is, right, he's doing more outreach than ever, even with, you know, all the proof that he really has already.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah, definitely important to increase those numbers.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and I'm going to be redoing my seven seeds framework for 2026.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll just share with you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, because if you don't know what it is right now, I'll tell you, but I'm going to be adding to it because there's definitely more seeds I need to add.
[SPEAKER_07]: So right now it's community,
[SPEAKER_07]: context to that community, communications, content creation, consistency, conversion, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the seven Cs right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm going to be adding something in the beginning and that's going to be caring.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like you have to care, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: I get to care about people.
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to care about the outcome that you're wanting to help people hit.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then community, uh,
[SPEAKER_07]: communications, content creation, consistent conversion, and then cash, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Because ultimately, like, we got to get a conversion, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's say they subscribe to your newsletter, or let's say they, you know, follow you, or let's say, you know, they download your free ebook.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: But ultimately we got to get that over to cash.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm going to be adding a couple of C's in there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, but people, you know, they, they need to know that you care as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is really important.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Gary V talks about it a lot, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like people don't care how much, you know, until they know how much you care.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, yeah, I mean, I think that's, that's some additional, um, content pieces that I'm going to be rolling out for 2026, but, um,
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, so the content system that I've been doing, it's been working really well.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like my numbers are up significantly and I've already booked some calls and yeah, it's just that visibility plus credibility equals profitability.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the ultimate funnel right now is a personal brand.
[SPEAKER_07]: Andy would approve of this, Gary V even talks about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you can build up an audience large enough
[SPEAKER_07]: And you're putting stuff out there like, Hey, this is what I'm building.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm looking for users.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, this is how Alex Finn does it.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is how everyone does it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now that has like large audiences that have invested years in building a following and a fan base.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, you just put it out there like, Hey, here's, here's my prelaunch, you know, sign up here.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're interested, this is what I'm building.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'd love to have you part of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, a cohort.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so yeah, like Christelle is really good at that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Jason is really good at that and And yeah, like that that's what it's all about.
[SPEAKER_07]: So We'd love to hear from people here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead Kevin I was gonna ask you a personal question Justin.
[SPEAKER_06]: When was the last time you got an inbound lead?
[SPEAKER_06]: And This is just important to really put it into perspective I think for people a pain one or just a lead I
[SPEAKER_07]: paying one?
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, yeah, it was about three weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got an inbound and it was an old, old colleague from like over 15 years ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: She reached out on LinkedIn and she's like, wow, I just saw that you built an AI platform.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I would, I would love to meet up and, you know, talk about that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we jumped on a call and I wasn't expecting even to get paid, but then I told her what I charge, you know, I was like, Hey,
[SPEAKER_07]: Mary Ellen, just so you know, I charge like $500 an hour.
[SPEAKER_07]: And she's like, oh, wow, okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then she DMed me after the call.
[SPEAKER_07]: And she's like, hey, what's your address?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm mailing you a check for $250.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was like, okay, that's really kind of you, thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's my address.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, she sent me a check for $250.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I wasn't even expecting it.
[SPEAKER_07]: But because she saw how much value that I dropped in that half hour, and I saved her like years of research.
[SPEAKER_07]: just by basically getting on the call with her and advising her on AI and consulting and you know because she was Kind of in between jobs, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: So but just that advice advisory alone, you know was worth it to her to pay to fit 250 Yeah, so hopefully that answers your question Kevin and and yeah, like those are rare and the only reason why I
[SPEAKER_07]: like I think she was able to turn into a paying client is because A, she saw how much work I was putting in for this month in October compared to my previous months, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: My content output, this is the formula I use, okay?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm gonna share with you guys everything right here.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys know I don't hold anything back, but here's the exact formula, okay?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's frequency, it's frequency,
[SPEAKER_07]: It's quality, it's quantity, and those three things, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's in, yeah, consistency, frequency, quality, quantity, all those things combined.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I just like 50 X to my content output for October, 50 X on all the platforms, videos, short forms, long forms, you know, fill in the blank, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: But I have like 50 X to my output.
[SPEAKER_07]: just in October.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think, I think even Justin can confirm this, the job father, he can confirm it because he's been interacting with my content on LinkedIn.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so he can, he can probably confirm it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's other people who have told me even, wow, Justin, you're like, you, you've been stepping up your content game.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm like, yeah, I'm, I'm stepping up my content game.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm, I'm, I'm 50 X-ing it right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: And look, I'm, I'm going to go even harder, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Once I get this automated system down,
[SPEAKER_07]: right where I can semi-automate my content, my output's gonna go up even more.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, I mean, that's what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not playing around here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Playtime's over.
[SPEAKER_07]: Look, playtime's over, guys, okay?
[SPEAKER_07]: 2026, I got a five-year plan.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm two years in, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm two years into this five-year plan, and I'm going hard for three years, three more years.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, hopefully that answers your question.
[SPEAKER_07]: Back over to you, Kevin.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah that's absolutely amazing too and it just shows the power of building a personal brand and actually really targeting one specific problem too right like getting those
[SPEAKER_06]: inbound leads are really just a bonus too.
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, you said you got this three weeks ago too.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you were only reliant on inbound leads, which is unfortunately what a lot of people rely on, you would be broke if that really is all you're working on at the end of the day too.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you really just, I cannot emphasis this enough.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like, to be honest, Justin, I only really started doing this amount of quantity of outreach
[SPEAKER_06]: only because of what you've really been teaching within these spaces just about a year ago or so, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: It really taught me the importance of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's just a game of math, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: If I'm going to be sending, so when I brought up the 400 DMs example, that was like one in a blue moon.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't ever do that many DMs abnormally.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe I'm sending 20 personalized and then 80 automated DMs that have people sign up for a newsletter or, you know, I give them some sort of offer.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's usually what a typical day looks like.
[SPEAKER_06]: 400 was just a bit of an experimental run, did a little bit of A-B testing even within the DMs through automation.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's still a work in progress, but it's just a game of math, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: If I'm doing 400 DMs, like I said, I managed to convert
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it was like 30 DMs.
[SPEAKER_06]: I managed to get a couple of leads, a couple of phone calls as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't matter what it is, but if we take that into a percentage point, it's about 5% or so.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the more you do, the more you're really going to get out as well too, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's just from cold DMs.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that doesn't refurbish, you know, an ICP that was kind of just, you know, people who were initially reacting to my posts.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are the people who I was outreaching.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it really is just a volume game, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Failed a thousand times, you end up winning once.
[SPEAKER_06]: Beautiful view, by the way.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was at the beach yesterday.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was amazing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, doing my walk here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Andy knows this spot pretty good in Carlsbad, but it's like right along the beach here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's a beautiful morning here.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's in like every movie ever.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's in like every Hollywood movie ever.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, well, let's get to these hands, Kevin.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for being here and having the co-host spot here, Kevin.
[SPEAKER_07]: Really appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_07]: And thanks for the wisdom you've been dropping, and it's fire as always.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, you just got to increase your output.
[SPEAKER_07]: You got to increase your frequency.
[SPEAKER_07]: You got to increase your outreach.
[SPEAKER_07]: You got to increase, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: You got to increase.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, let's jump forward to Christelle, and then we'll go to the job father.
[SPEAKER_07]: Christelle, good morning.
[SPEAKER_07]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_07]: Hopefully, you're enjoying this view.
[SPEAKER_04]: Am enjoying the view I'm not gonna talk smack about Miami's beaches because you know Oceans are oceans and this is a beautiful one.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all I'll say.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know what you're on it I'm not so you're winning You can have the sand in your I don't know if people know this but the ocean is my heart like it's my favorite place I'm the type of person that scares people because I will swim out in the ocean like much further than you would think is appropriate
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, I often have lifeguards, you know blowing their whistle at me telling me to come back so I'm the fish in the water and I decided that I'm gonna start Romeo on the swim lessons because he's three now.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's time for him to learn For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi everyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Happy Saturday.
[SPEAKER_04]: What a blessing and honor to be in here with you all Justin Kevin and
[SPEAKER_04]: The Job Fathers here, and Edwin and Jason, and Dan Ryan!
[SPEAKER_04]: OMG!
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like a celebrity has joined us.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how I feel about Dan Ryan.
[SPEAKER_04]: Love him so, love him so.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi Rio, good to see you, and Summer, Avni, everyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: What a nice pop-up space, and I love this conversation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Justin you'd be proud of me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I busted out Apollo again for like the 15th time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know I busted it out and I said, you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna use it differently this time because now I know my ICP right so I can Specifically target and this is easy because these my ICPs are in nonprofits so I can easily just look for and that's what I did I did a filter for executive directors of nonprofits and board members because now that you and Andy have helped me
[SPEAKER_04]: Narrow down my ICP and the thing I had to realize is just because that's my ICP does not mean I'm not working with every other type of person.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't mean I'm not working with solopreneurs.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't mean I'm not working with corporate people and that's the hurdle I had to get over and I think many people have to get over is that they think
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, by saying this is my ICP, they're somehow excluding all these other people.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: Having this understanding has helped me so much because now I can use tools like Apollo.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is what I did.
[SPEAKER_04]: So instead of doing like the email, the cold email sequence, I'm going straight to LinkedIn.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to use it as my LinkedIn automator tool because I can search.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can search for
[SPEAKER_04]: my ICP, so executive directors and board members specifically of nonprofits, so that's really specific, in the U.S. And then here's the cool thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can also see who has a LinkedIn account and who doesn't.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's two different segments, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because one segment is, hey, you don't have a LinkedIn account and you probably need one,
[SPEAKER_04]: But I can email them, right, so I can email them.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a whole segment of does your, and then look into does their nonprofit have an email account.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can search in that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then on the other side, Rio's given me the hundreds, he knows.
[SPEAKER_04]: On the other side, I can use Apollo to set up the LinkedIn sequence.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it will automatically, so the first step will be to pull up their profile.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it makes it easy for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I can just look at the profile.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the second step is to send them the connection request and then the DM.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I'm like, you know what, if I'm gonna automate this, let me just go for the gold and go to the highest level that I'm actually trying to get.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because like you, Justin, I really, honestly, I don't want to say I'm good on clients because I always welcome abundance and more wealth.
[SPEAKER_04]: But praise God like I'm I'm great.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm in a great place right now But I could use you know, we could always use one or two more So I'm not going for I'm gonna go for the quality right now So that because that's all I need is one or two, you know, so Justin I see your hand I don't want to talk much
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I just want to add a pro tip for you, Christelle, because this is a big one.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you want to add sending them a contact message on their company website form and also email them directly if you have their email and also phone call.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, I sent you, this is Christelle, you know, founder of the Miami global.
[SPEAKER_07]: I sent you a connection request and an inquiry email.
[SPEAKER_07]: about how I specialize in X, Y, Z, helping nonprofits go from A to B transformations.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just want to make sure you guys got that, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: So after, after you do the outreach.
[SPEAKER_07]: So add those additional touch points again.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, Justin, do you think I should be reaching out?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think I'm doing this correctly, reaching out to the board members and the executive directors, or should I be, or both?
[SPEAKER_04]: I should also be reaching out to the nonprofit account too, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, both.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, both.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's called account-based marketing, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: So we call it account-based marketing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And account-based marketing is basically you have an account that you wanna go after, a company you wanna go after.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you have to be a bit broad, but you start with the higher ups, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Because they're the decision makers, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: They're the decision makers.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yes, yes, yes, and yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: And just make sure you add in for everyone else too, because it's really important.
[SPEAKER_07]: Make sure you add in
[SPEAKER_07]: following up on a phone call after you sent the email, after you sent the contact form, after you sent the connection request, and also sending them a message on their contact form on their website.
[SPEAKER_07]: And also if you have their email, sending them an email.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it can be your personal email account, or it can be a third party, like instantly, or something like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love the contact form on the website.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wouldn't have thought of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really good.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're like, we've got to cover all bases.
[SPEAKER_04]: Next, I'm going to show up at your house, OK?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, yeah, that's, that's the next step.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you should test this locally too, is even in Miami where you are, there's some nonprofits.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, you may want to just drop by there one time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I was just in the area at a local lunch space, a lunch spot, you know, that I really enjoy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, so just wanted to introduce myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how I got the job with the chamber.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just walked in there, literally just walked in.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't underestimate that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause, cause it's different, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Everyone's online, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: So when I pop into like I'm targeting biotechs right now, I'm targeting biotechs, I'm doing the same thing right now on LinkedIn, contact forms, calls, emails, I'm doing the same exact thing with biotechs right now in San Diego, because biotech is like big here and I've worked with biotechs.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm doing the same exact thing as you're doing with nonprofits right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: All you need is like one or two biotech companies, I'm good to go.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I'm good to go, guys, okay?
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me just tell you, okay, with those high ticket price points, you know, a fractional CMO for a biotech, dude, it's, that's where, that 20K will come real quickly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: And don't you find that you don't want to let people waste your time as much because you're like, you know, the, like this woman I was telling you about that wants to do the, she was interested in the 97, you know, a month for $7 an hour.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's low ticket people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like that's low ticket.
[SPEAKER_04]: And she's over here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, can we talk about it again?
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got all these questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, yo, you either take it for a month and then never do it again.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: You tried it for a month.
[SPEAKER_04]: But no, we're not going to keep getting on calls about a $97 a month offer.
[SPEAKER_04]: All of a sudden, I'm like, I have no time for this, which is a really good thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the faster you can get there, even if you're not selling these high ticket, still get there faster than I did.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the sooner you stop wasting your time with those type of people, you will attract
[SPEAKER_04]: your ideal high ticket or even the lower ticket are still the ideal kind, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: But we do not want to attract people that want to waste our time and penny pinch on any of our offers, even our biggest offer.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't want anyone that's really whining about the price because that means they're really questioning the value.
[SPEAKER_04]: So anyways, all right.
[SPEAKER_04]: What a great space.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, they just need to be educated more.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Christelle, like they just need to do more due diligence on Okay, who is Christelle?
[SPEAKER_07]: What does she do?
[SPEAKER_07]: And what is her track record?
[SPEAKER_07]: Right?
[SPEAKER_07]: And same thing with me, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: And same thing with the job bothering Kevin, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: If someone is not like, ready to invest, right, then they just haven't done enough education due diligence, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: So I've actually told people, like, literally, I've told people I was like, Look, no offense, but, you know, I charge $500 an hour here.
[SPEAKER_07]: and I appreciate the conversation, but I highly suggest that you go do more due diligence before we get on a call next time, because obviously it's clear that you just haven't done any homework on who I am and what I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to start saying that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's so good.
[SPEAKER_04]: But as a woman, I'd be called the B-I-T-C-H. You're allowed to say that, but if I say that, it's like, that B.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah Go ahead I'm sorry No, I was I was really sad to hear that you have to have surgery man like on the Achilles, bro So I'm praying for you and a recovery man.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, man, just wanted to you know, make sure I got that out there man, so
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, sending a lot of love and prayers your way, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey man, I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for having me, Justin, Kevin, Andy, Christelle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always good to see you guys and everybody else who's here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The surgery went well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had it on Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, by the grace of God, I am a freak of nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bounce back quickly, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The worst part is over, surgery is done, so I'm healing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I'm just getting back to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want to start, I wasn't going to say this, but Christelle, F those people, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you're absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people who nickel and dime you, they want the most help for nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's so annoying.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, you try to be nice, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you try to help people because you feel bad, but then you realize they just take advantage of you, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I had, and please don't take this the wrong way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody, any women in here, but this is just an example I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a client who,
[SPEAKER_00]: Really needed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: She said she needed a discount.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave her a discount because she's been so unemployed for so long.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then she comes on in our next meeting.
[SPEAKER_00]: She has a full length sew-in that is new.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you know anything about sew-ins, those are like $300.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my gosh, I'm cracking up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, come on now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anywho, I can go on a whole tirade about that, but I say let's stick together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once you know your worth, like you do, Christella, like I do and everybody else here, it becomes a lot easier to turn that down because it's less of a headache.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, with the type of services I provide, those type of people, they're usually hard to place because they're lazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll land that plane.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Justin, I have to fuss at you, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ready to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got me so interested in your AI.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to purchase it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I go to your LinkedIn profile, it's not the visit my website link.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have your first chapter of your book.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not what I'm interested in based upon everything you've been posting about, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get to the website.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Come for Justin.
[SPEAKER_04]: Justin, go for Justin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Justin, I'm ready to buy, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on, I don't want to look too hard for your website.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm going to look anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go get it anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just a word of advice as a friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Under your profile where it says first chapter of my book, change that to your Revenue Ronin website, your AI site.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK. Oh, the AI site, not the agency site?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it says the first chapter of my book.
[SPEAKER_00]: like when you link your profile, it's not going to your AI site.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything you've been posting about has been building a funnel to gauge to buy your AI or to sign up for your AI.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not readily available on your profile.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, yeah, thanks for that feedback.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you're right.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's a disconnect here, because I'm trying to build my email list, first and foremost.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, some people like you are really interested in the revenueroaning.ai.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, let me
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, let me let me send you that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, like, please go through that process.
[SPEAKER_07]: And look, if you sign up, I will refund you the first, you know, the first one, because I need a tester.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm gonna sign up now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do have a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's perfectly fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you tell me I need to book time to get this answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I see that you use cloud, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in the same space of trying to get job father AI off of the chat GPT platform and into my own site like you did.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I've been saying is that Claude gives you limits on how much you can use per month.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you run into that problem?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I haven't experienced the limit yet because I haven't had too many people sign up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, I've had zero sign up yet, so that's number one.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I did put a cap in there, a threshold.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hopefully it works, but yeah, like I think I have like a 10 or $20, uh, buffer there.
[SPEAKER_07]: So once those credits are gone with that $20, then it alerts me.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I just like basically pay again to, uh, add additional credits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that scalable though?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because for instance, for, for my, for what my people would use my job, father AI for if they're using it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to reach these limits, I'm saying fairly quickly, even with one or two signups.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you feel like for you it's worth it in terms of scaling up and return on investment?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's worth it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, we just got to you got to run the numbers, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, I mean, it's it's worth it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You just got to run the numbers.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what your price points are.
[SPEAKER_07]: But But yeah, and then you have to set caps.
[SPEAKER_07]: So like I said, a cap that only one person can run it per purchase, like, so it's $47 or whatever it is, they get to run it one time.
[SPEAKER_07]: They can't run it again.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I had to make sure I had to go into lovable
[SPEAKER_07]: and make sure I programmed that guide rail, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: You had to specify that, because yeah, a lot of people, from what I've been hearing about, is they forget to add the guard rails for the token usage, and then they end up with like $300 bills, you know?
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's like the person only paid like 10 bucks, you know?
[SPEAKER_07]: So you definitely don't want that to happen.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, man, I appreciate the interest there.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, that revenue running.ai, it's like,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, that was a vision I had like two years ago, just to share with everyone.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I took all my knowledge and I built it out in Lovable, thanks to Vinod and thanks to Christelle and many others on this platform.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, the idea is that look, I can't afford $500 an hour, but I can just upload
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, my stuff into here.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then it, it, it's like Justin, it's an AI of Justin, like the revenue Ronan.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he's going to tell you exactly what you need to hear to improve conversions, drive more revenue with your ads data, your email marketing data, or your landing page or website.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's all based on.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm so excited.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it's all based on my framework.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, but yeah, man, book a call with me, Justin, like let's,
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's get on a call, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would love to talk to you more about it and run you through it and get you as a beta tester, because I got to start rolling that out.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's good to hear that feedback that all my content for the last month has been really aggressively pushing the revenue run into AI.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's how I got you interested, and I got another person interested to actually pay me for a half hour.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, thank you for that feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: No worries.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in the process of signing up now, so I'll let you know how it goes, and then I'll get that call, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll go ahead and do that as we speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: But thanks for having me, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have to drop off because Netta's hosting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to be a bad co-founder and not join.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'll be here for at least another 10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, thank you, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: I appreciate, always appreciate you coming through and supporting the spaces as always, and your friendship.
[SPEAKER_07]: And thanks for being a Ronin, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: You've been in the ranks, you know?
[SPEAKER_07]: So like, that's, you know, that's what it's all about, guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, ultimately, the mission is 1,000 Ronins, guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's the mission.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're on this mission, and we're not stopping.
[SPEAKER_07]: So stick with me, guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Stick with me.
[SPEAKER_07]: So thanks, John Father.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, I'm going to try to show up tomorrow on the space, just TBD in between, like,
[SPEAKER_07]: family stuff and church stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, it was awesome to spend time with you and Netta and Andy and Sherilyn last week.
[SPEAKER_07]: I really enjoyed that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Same here, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Christelle, again, remember, forget those people all the way.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: I already forgot them and I will forget them in the future forever.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_04]: I needed that boost of encouragement.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Justin Jobfather, I'm jumping on you and I'm coming for Justin results too, because I didn't even really know about this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I feel behind because, you know, I'm not on LinkedIn like that, but I'm here on X with you every day.
[SPEAKER_04]: up on this stage?
[SPEAKER_04]: Why isn't that link like up in the Jumbotron?
[SPEAKER_04]: What is going on?
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm coming for your neck.
[SPEAKER_04]: Put the link in the Jumbotron every time.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, treat it like it's the sponsor of the show.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I do with Miami Global to make sure that I talk about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I say Miami Global is sponsoring this workshop like the workshop I did yesterday.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, that's sponsored by Miami Global because it makes me remember to bring it up because it's very easy not to bring it up.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, I want to see it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd love is it the revenue Ronan dot com or is a totally different site?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah, I'm just going to.
[SPEAKER_07]: a
[SPEAKER_07]: This has been my brainchild for like two years, and I finally got it done thanks to watching a video from Vinod.
[SPEAKER_07]: And guys, literally, I've had zero programming experience.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't miss it though.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the crazy thing, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: But this just goes to show you, I didn't miss it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I remember seeing it in a newsletter at some point.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember, you know, here and there, but it just goes to show that for some reason, I never clicked on the link.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's because I would have had to go search for it, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just didn't search.
[SPEAKER_04]: I let it kind of go in one ear and out the other.
[SPEAKER_04]: So even someone as close to me, as close to you as me, who is all on you, on your stuff, you know what I'm saying, can miss it.
[SPEAKER_04]: somehow so the link is so important that's that's the lesson here for all of us and Ani knows I like spank people for this I spank her she spanks me like we all seriously because it's so easy to do like right now I'm about to put my
[SPEAKER_04]: Miami Global link back up, but I took it down because I was more focused on my newsletter.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we have to be really clear on the links that are up there.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I take that buy me a coffee link down, guess what?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't get coffees.
[SPEAKER_04]: The moment I put that buy me a coffee link up, I make money.
[SPEAKER_04]: So guess what?
[SPEAKER_04]: Guess what link is saying up there, no matter what, the buy me a coffee.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that Buy Me A Coffee, almost every time I host a space or co-host, especially with Ani, I make money.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like even if it's 10 bucks, 20 bucks.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that adds up.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the links are so important.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in these spaces, Justin, that you're doing every single day.
[SPEAKER_04]: let this be the first link always and then it'll help us also remember as co-hosts and speakers to talk about this because this is this is the thing like this is your your baby your baby is born let's give it some clothes and attention and a name and you know let us mama and uncle and aunt it okay thank you
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, thank you for that coaching, guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I'm very coachable.
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you, Jobfather and Christelle.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is why these masterminds are so powerful is like, you come here, and we're all about growing and building our businesses, bringing in more revenue.
[SPEAKER_07]: And look, we don't know it all, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Myself included, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll be the first to admit it.
[SPEAKER_07]: But one thing is you got to be coachable, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: There's certain people that they're not coachable.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I'll just say that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And
[SPEAKER_07]: For you, in order to level up, you have to be coachable, you have to be a lifelong learner, and that's the only way you're gonna make progress.
[SPEAKER_07]: Andy, he's a great coach, but some people just aren't coachable.
[SPEAKER_07]: Andy's much more graceful than me, I'll just say that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Andy will show a lot more grace than I will.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: You gotta be coachable.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I always ask, I learned this the hard way, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: I always ask, incorporate with clients, fill in the blank.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've learned this the hard way, okay?
[SPEAKER_07]: I always ask, hey, are you open to some coaching?
[SPEAKER_07]: before I give my two cents now.
[SPEAKER_07]: I used to just go into coaching mode right away.
[SPEAKER_07]: And people were not ready for that.
[SPEAKER_07]: It blew back on me pretty hard.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I've learned from experience.
[SPEAKER_07]: So take it from me, always ask people, hey, are you open to some coaching?
[SPEAKER_07]: And then proceed from there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because again, not everyone's open to coaching.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, great stuff here, guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Kevin, jump in for a second.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to text my wife, so jump in for a second.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I actually had my hand up for a second, and it's about being coachable.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have this quote.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, I don't know if anybody else has said this, but I always tell myself, the day you stop learning is the day you stop living.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're learning, you're going through things, you're building your curiosity, and there's just something about it too, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think a lot of people are, in the nicest way possible, I want to put it, are quite self-centered.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not really looking to learn, but it's always those who humble themselves are actually coachable and are willing to learn and go above and beyond and even invest in coaching or mentorships or even courses.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like those are the people that are going to learn.
[SPEAKER_06]: and end up growing a lot, even if it's not like niche, you know, specific, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I've learned a ton about human biology and about, you know, the fitness industry really benefit my business directly, but I tell, but I tell you, man, it's building up that healthy lifestyle really does add a big, big role into all of this as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: So really, really important.
[SPEAKER_06]: Lesson here as well, and I was gonna say to you Yeah, like crystal is gonna kill you for the funnel Justin because crystal is all about that funnel building So if that links not gonna take you to the website directly read You know chapters among chapters before you get to the link.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that could really destroy your overall conversions I think Statistics show up to even 60% and that is a huge margin that you're missing out on So yeah, just having a link directly absolutely killer
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm in the same position as you, Christa.
[SPEAKER_06]: I took down my buy me a coffee link.
[SPEAKER_06]: And instead of having buy me a coffee sales, I've been seeing a lot more email signups, of course, right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then just based off our business model, right, you go based off of what you find more valuable, too.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you get what you put in.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, well, let me ask you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I've been really prioritizing building my email list because
[SPEAKER_07]: Mike, I've been slacking on my email list building for the last year.
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't been growing my email list for a year.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I've grown like 50 people, but that's because, number one, I wasn't on Beehive.
[SPEAKER_07]: Number two, I wasn't focusing attention on it, which is why my new funnel has been the strategy to go more into building the list.
[SPEAKER_07]: If your content is all about pushing RevenueRonin.ai in this AI ads-powered platform, you gotta make sure it matches, the links match with the content strategy, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: You need an input form, Justin.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your top priority is to collect email, and there's no way I can put an email in when I first open the link.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's the first thing you need to do, and you know, Lovable is great at that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just literally ask for the input form, ask that it goes in the heroes section,
[SPEAKER_04]: and then you can even do the webhook very easily in Make to then send it to a spreadsheet or send it right to Beehive.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll do all of it for you, but if that's your priority, which I agree it should always be, I will not do another landing page or website that does not have an input form in the hero section.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why?
[SPEAKER_04]: Give them a way to just click and then start running it as your community, as your community signup.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to join the revenue, Ronan?
[SPEAKER_04]: Make sure you go to revenue Ronan AI, put your email in, you'll join the community.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the free level of the community, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, they can join here, but you want their email.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you got to take them off here and get their email as your community, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And you run that as your, is this where your newsletter is coming from?
[SPEAKER_07]: No, the revenue Ronin AI that's just strictly the lovable app.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so and I need to Okay, cool You know, it's all tied together.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all branded revenue Ronin So they should start getting the revenue Ronin newsletters and then it just it's on their mind.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not you're on my mind You're in my newsletter, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm in your spaces.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm now I'm on this website I should have a way to put my email in right away and
[SPEAKER_04]: and then put one of your ebooks or something so that you have a lead magnet and that'll boost you like the lead magnets really work on the landing page and you already have so much stuff you know so just find something and rotate here's my free gift to you and then the input and you'll see those especially if you start pushing this link every single space
[SPEAKER_04]: Every single space push this link watch we're all gonna push it We're all and you're gonna see how fast you're you know your email list grows seriously because it's the spaces link connection that people miss Spaces isn't just great because you can build an audience But because you got to run it like we used to do on Clubhouse on Clubhouse.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is how people made money and
[SPEAKER_04]: Hoops knows because they used to use the billboard.
[SPEAKER_04]: And guess what?
[SPEAKER_04]: You could only have one.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was the most important link.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you had to be mindful of what you were going to put there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that was better than being able to have all these links.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, Timo's told me I'm savage.
[SPEAKER_04]: The links at the top.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I will take people's links down because I that seriously, that's a billboard.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this has to be your billboard every single space.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then just just like you do your sponsors every and then say,
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, you want to join the revenue running community?
[SPEAKER_04]: Make sure you click on that link.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll start, you know, put your email list and you'll start getting my newsletter, blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow, thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Christelle.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's it's fragmented right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: I need to clean it up.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I have plenty of content.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yes, thank you for that feedback.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm very coachable.
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wouldn't even call it fragmented.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you have the entire system.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're just.
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, connecting the train cars now or whatever.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Justin, uh, I'll reach out to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just purchased it, but it's giving me some issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so I'll reach out or if you can reach out to me, look at that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I purchased and I got the receipt, but then it's telling me that it's a, it's, I still haven't purchased.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll reach out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can reach out to me after the meeting.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if we have some time to connect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but I'm eager to get started here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: You got it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Justin.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure if you're around later today or you want to sit, I can send you my, my county link, whatever you want to do, but, um, I'll make myself available today for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can be available today.
[SPEAKER_00]: No worries.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, we're building in public real time here.
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: John father.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Christelle, Kevin.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Your guys' advice has been really helpful here and, um, I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And,
[SPEAKER_06]: a
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm hearing like these like really good things.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not really understanding it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So would it be maybe possible to have a space and just, you know, have an open discussion about it?
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just did a workshop yesterday.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll send you the replay link.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you remind me, send me the DM.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an hour.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an hour workshop.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've got other, I've got shorter content too, but lovable.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every one of us should know how to use lovable period.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like if like it is the future of, you know, of AI and not just lovable.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would say everyone needs to also learn Manus.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, that's the other AI tool that everyone Manus lovable.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yes, there are other people come in and be like, Oh, well I use bowl.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, use the competitor, but I'm only gonna bring you the tools that I've really tested and I've tested them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lovable builds the most beautiful websites.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you care about design, which I do, right, and we should, then go for Lovable.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't really care about design and maybe you'll get slightly better coding and functionality the first time around, then yeah, go for Bolt.
[SPEAKER_04]: But to me, the Bolt websites were ugly, so I left it and stayed with Lovable.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that sounds awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I just had a network actually event in my church as well, like Playa del Carmen is like filled with like entrepreneurs.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like boom in there, especially in the real estate market, but they have a really good online presence there too.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're talking about AI and a lovable came up as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that really caught my eye because of actually Christelle.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know she's always preaching about it as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't really the chat GPT of vibe websites, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: He is the first, you know, for the generative AI lovable is at the top.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is leading the way for vibe coding just in general website building, you know, at building.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's leading the way.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, not just yeah, not just web, not just websites, Kevin.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's important to have this distinction.
[SPEAKER_07]: So app building and website building.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's like not just websites, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, you have to understand that because again, this is what I built with the revenue Ronan.ai is it came with an entire back end database.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, it came with AI integrated, it came with
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, security, it came with everything, like I would have to pay a programmer and it would take them six months before, okay, if I wanted this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, I built it in six hours and I've never coded every, the only thing I've done is like WordPress and landing pages, okay, like and Squarespace and Wix, you know, websites, like I'm basic template guy, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: But for me to go through the entire process in six hours and get a fully functioning,
[SPEAKER_07]: website slash SAS, which is a software as a service application.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's huge.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's that's that's next level.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the reason why I went with lovable is because Vinod's video was so good.
[SPEAKER_07]: It took you through a process of, okay, here's you can use Canva.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is like beginner level.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you can use lovable, which is kind of intermediate.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then Bolt is more advanced.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was like a progression.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I was like, well, I like this lovable.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm gonna check it out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Christelle's always been talking about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So boom, I did lovable.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then yeah, literally six hours later, you know, three in the morning, boom, I have a fully functional.
[SPEAKER_04]: You caught the bug.
[SPEAKER_04]: For me it was an entire weekend staying up till like two o'clock in the morning building apps.
[SPEAKER_04]: All of a sudden I was an app builder.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I went through all my credits in one night.
[SPEAKER_07]: All my $25 worth of credits or whatever it is, I burned through it in one night.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not even one month.
[SPEAKER_07]: One night, I have zero credits now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Ani and I cry every day about being lovable and man is poor.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've both spent as much money as we can spend on the site without going to the $200 level, and we're out of credits.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why Ani's telling Kevin, you gotta get it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was about to say, she made me burn two emails to get credits.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes!
[SPEAKER_04]: No, she's out here hustling.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're over here hustling for lovable credits and Manus credits.
[SPEAKER_04]: And look, I'm not ashamed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I will give you my Manus thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys, I need Manus credits too.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've gotten all my money for the month, but here's the trick.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm gonna make this super quick.
[SPEAKER_04]: Before you go to lovable, have Manus write the prompt for you, okay?
[SPEAKER_04]: So go take your idea, put it into Manus, but here's the trick.
[SPEAKER_04]: to not running out of credits in Manus.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to switch to chat mode.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't know this existed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was running wild in agent mode and blew through my credits.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to manually change it to chat mode and chat mode is free in Manus.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't know this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I know my life has changed.
[SPEAKER_04]: So chat mode in Manus
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell it you're going to build an app in Lovable.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: Brainstorm with me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once you're happy with it, say turn this into a Lovable prompt and then you copy and paste that prompt into Lovable or the pro tip is to into some document, change it, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a template, so put your actual information in it and then go paste it into the Lovable prompt
[SPEAKER_04]: hit enter and let your mind be blown.
[SPEAKER_04]: And make sure you've got the next seven hours, you know, to go into the rabbit hole.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, I just want to say I will work for AI credits.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll work for AI credits.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, you know, that's where we're going.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's gonna be a viral TikTok video.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, guys, right there.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, we'll work for AI credits, you know.
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's a good pro tip, Christelle.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why I burned through my credits, too, because I didn't switch to the chat mode instead of the actual programming mode in Lovable.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, good call out there.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, guys, this has been a great space.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to keep it going.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I'm still doing my walk here, but I just wanted to show you guys this view here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hopefully, you guys are enjoying this view.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, this is a...
[SPEAKER_07]: There's an awesome view here of the jetty right here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Got the jetties here in Carlsbad.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah, we got some hands up here, but anything else to add here, AJ or Christelle, before we go to AJ?
[SPEAKER_04]: How far are you from those big, beautiful cliffs?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I love about San Diego that we definitely don't have are those gorgeous cliffs.
[SPEAKER_06]: What she's asking is, will you jump?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my gosh, no, not unless it's safe.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do love some cliff jumping.
[SPEAKER_07]: I do love cliff jumping.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've done, I've done, I've done cliff jumping.
[SPEAKER_07]: I, and Kevin, you need to go check out the cenotes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully you've done the cenotes.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been to like all of them in my area.
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually just came from one.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was fantastic.
[SPEAKER_06]: Literally crystal clear.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like it cause it's also not saltwater, but the best part is they had zip lining.
[SPEAKER_06]: So me and my brothers,
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you best believe I think we went on there like 20 times.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was incredible.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's freaking awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: I love the cenotes, which the cenotes is what's the translation there?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like a really like water cave or something.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll have to look it up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Water cave.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: And those are fun, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: You just jump right in.
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, I went to the highest level.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, no, no.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's the highest?
[SPEAKER_07]: I need the highest, you know, so.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I won't do skydiving.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll do like cliff jumping.
[SPEAKER_07]: Really?
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I won't do skydiving.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to have to sign you up for skydiving against your free will.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you're going to have to do it because I've already paid for it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's just a guilt trip thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd actually much rather do skydiving.
[SPEAKER_04]: then I think bungee jumping.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't mess with my neck.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've done a lot of cliff jumping, but I haven't done it in like nine years because the last time I did it, I almost died.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I didn't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I went into the water and I came up and I was there with a group of people.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when I came out of the water, my best friend was crying.
[SPEAKER_04]: They all looked shocked because that's how close I was to the rocks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like somehow I didn't hit the rock, but it looked like I was going to hit the rock.
[SPEAKER_04]: So God saved me a few times in these cliff jumping, high risk activities that I did all over the world in my younger days.
[SPEAKER_04]: So at some point I said, OK, I'm going to stop overworking my, you know, guardian angels.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow, man, that's scary.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'm glad.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, like there's been some close calls like you got to check the shallowness of like you got to do your due diligence before you jump in.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, it's been some close calls.
[SPEAKER_07]: So but yeah, it's like we got to be more careful now that we're parents, you know, so.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, good stuff, guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's go over to AJ here.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just want to recognize Dan Ryan.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's in the room here.
[SPEAKER_07]: So good to see you, Dan.
[SPEAKER_07]: Good to see Jason, Edwin, Hoops, everyone down below.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're just doing a little fun little Saturday pop-up space here at the beach.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, I really appreciate Kevin and Christelle kind of co-hosting here.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, over to you, AJ.
[SPEAKER_07]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey everyone, how's it going?
[SPEAKER_05]: So I heard you guys talking about lovable, so I just want to come up here and ask you a couple questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: What is the benefits using lovable compared to like Claude code like Anthropix command line interface tool?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like what's the benefit using lovable over that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because normally with tech there's a lot of hype around it like Devin.
[SPEAKER_05]: They said Devin was going to replace software developers or DP came around and they said they're going to be the next chat GBT and now you don't hear about those things anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I remain like willingly ignorant about certain things, certain tech trends, unless I see they start to stay around.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I'm like, okay, now I'm interested.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me find out what this is.
[SPEAKER_05]: So why lovable?
[SPEAKER_05]: Why choose lovable?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'll jump in here and then Christelle, thanks for grabbing the co-host and you can jump in after me.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the first indicator that I typically look at is the company growth and revenue.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: I look at company growth.
[SPEAKER_07]: and I look at revenue, that's number one.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's a, I don't know where the image is, but I can try to find it after this, but to see how much growth that they've had early on, where they have user adoption and actual paying members, that's clear indicator of market viability.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's one indicator.
[SPEAKER_07]: The second thing is actual,
[SPEAKER_07]: use of the tool yourself and or others in your close community.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Christelle and Vinod and some others in our circle of friends, they've been using Lovable.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I jumped on the Lovable bandwagon myself.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was just able to experience how easy it was to accomplish both front end and back end development in one interface that ties it all together.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, I mean, those are just the two, three indicators that I look at.
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, I'm not a programmer, I'm not a developer, but from taking somebody that has a sales and marketing and tech background and able to spin up a fully functional SaaS in six hours was pretty impressive.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, but yeah, just keep an eye on Lovable.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I know there's,
[SPEAKER_07]: There's many different ways to do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's not one way, but, you know, I see the trend of the company and what they're building and putting together and the growth.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's something that I really pay attention to, especially around paying users.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, yeah, hopefully that answers your question, but Christelle jump in here for AJ.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, this is such a good question.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I love your answer, Justin.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a couple answers that are different.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would say Justin and I are the ideal client, you know, for them, like we, because this product was made for people like us that
[SPEAKER_04]: have the community, have the audience, have the ideas, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: We're entrepreneurs, we have businesses, Kevin, you know, many people in here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We just need access to the tools that are going to help us put together these assets for ourselves, you know, these websites and apps and because we have all the ideas.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the fact that it took us from nothing to transformation is the seller for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've tried these other tools, the app in four hours that was connected and ready to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I used it and tried it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just never happened.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I stick with the one that I actually got the transformation from.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why did we stick with Canva?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we were never able to create a flyer before without hiring a designer.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then all of a sudden,
[SPEAKER_04]: We're creating an amazing flyer, so I'm never leaving Canva again.
[SPEAKER_04]: Canva is the best for what it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: What we're here to do is share the best tools for the things that we need as entrepreneurs, creators, builders.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these are the best tools so for vibe coding.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I stand firm that Lovable is the best tool for a newsletter.
[SPEAKER_04]: I stand firm that beehive is the best tool for a generative AI Unfortunately, I still stand from that GPT is even though they do questionable things, you know, and my value system is constantly Yeah, and
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, sorry, were you done, Crystal?
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't wanna jump in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah, no, that's it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, it's just, it's really about the tools that we use that are, and for me, I'm.
[SPEAKER_06]: Crystal, I think we lost her.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'll just add for AJ here, so, and for everyone.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, great, great, great share, Crystal.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's exactly right.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, lovable is good for getting an MVP done as a founder, as a business owner.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: And look, if I was like, you know, shout out to Dan Ryan or anyone else who wants to bring in revenue.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like quickly is, you know, use lovable or use these tools to, you know, turn around sites for companies like quickly and sell them.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like you can sell full blown applications.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, you can sell it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can acquire customers, you can build them an MVP, charge them for it, and boom, it's ready to go.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then from that, they have MVP, and then they start bringing in revenue, because here's the thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't matter at the end of the day what you build.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's about, is it working, and is it bringing in revenue?
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it allowing their business to function?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what they care about at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_07]: Why?
[SPEAKER_07]: Why do I say this?
[SPEAKER_07]: Because in my past, when I had my IT business, and I made a million dollars in five years, and I only netted 50 grand, I went to all my top clients.
[SPEAKER_07]: I said, hey, you guys have websites.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is from 2003, 2004, to 2009, in that time span.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I went to them, I said, hey, you guys have websites.
[SPEAKER_07]: How is it working?
[SPEAKER_07]: They're like, it's not working, Justin.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not getting leads, it's not getting sales, it's not working.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was like, all right, well, let me get back to you.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I spent 90 days teaching myself a PhD in digital marketing.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm shifting out of IT, I'm going into digital marketing.
[SPEAKER_07]: I went back to those top clients and I said, hey, give me 90 days, let me show you results.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me get you more traffic, more targeted traffic, more leads and help you drive more sales from your existing website that you spent 50 grand on.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is this something you're open to?
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're like, yeah, definitely open to that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And all those five clients, they became my first customers in my marketing agency.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I pivoted, I got out of IT, I went fully into digital marketing.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I've been doing for 15 years.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the point is,
[SPEAKER_07]: Just having a website is great, but what really matters is what is the website doing for their business?
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it helping them save time?
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it helping them save money?
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it increasing their productivity?
[SPEAKER_07]: Are they acquiring customers?
[SPEAKER_07]: Are they getting signups?
[SPEAKER_07]: Are they driving revenue?
[SPEAKER_07]: Are they driving sales?
[SPEAKER_07]: And this video that I just put here, the pinned post, okay, the $33 million per employee company,
[SPEAKER_07]: It just broke my brain.
[SPEAKER_07]: This analysis that I walk through, I walk through all the fastest growing companies in AI right now, and I do an analysis.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a very good video, so make sure you watch it, AJ.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it demonstrates why these companies are getting significant growth.
[SPEAKER_07]: And revenue per employee.
[SPEAKER_07]: Revenue per employee.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's an indicator that you want to keep an eye on.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, back over to you, AJ.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hopefully that answers your question pretty comprehensively.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so I just wanted to ask, is Levelboard just another agent like Cloud Code?
[SPEAKER_05]: Or is there some other feature on top of that that makes it better?
[SPEAKER_07]: No, they're not an agent.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, they're not an agent.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're a fully comprehensive
[SPEAKER_07]: solution that ties, again, front end, back end, super base, all these other components that you need together in one, which integrates with everything you need to run a fully functional SaaS app or whatever you want to run, as opposed to going to all these different companies and piecemealing it together.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, it's not an agent.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you got it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And guys, make sure you guys watch that video that I did because it's like eight minutes.
[SPEAKER_07]: But this is like I've never seen a big trend like this before in all my I've been studying startups a long time.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I have the videos to prove it from like 10, 12 years ago when I used to do analysis.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I've never seen something as big of a trend as what I'm seeing right now with these AI startups, because the revenue per employee, OK, the typical startup that gets venture capital funding
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, you used to need like 500, 200 employees, 300 employees.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now guess what?
[SPEAKER_07]: You only need under 10, under five.
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the persons that's on the list is like two people.
[SPEAKER_07]: And because they have agents.
[SPEAKER_07]: To AJ's point, they have agents.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's one guy on X here, John Rush.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, the guy's running.
[SPEAKER_07]: 20 different companies, and he's got like two people, and he's making $2.3 million a year with his 20 companies, all from all his AI agents.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I've never seen anything like this.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a huge trend.
[SPEAKER_07]: You do not need venture capital funding.
[SPEAKER_07]: You do not need that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Traditionally, you would need that.
[SPEAKER_07]: You'd need big staff.
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't need that anymore.
[SPEAKER_07]: Lovable is a mean and lean AI startup from Norway,
[SPEAKER_07]: that's crushing it, the hockey stick growth that they're experiencing, paying customers, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like these are things you need to look at.
[SPEAKER_07]: These are indicators, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: These are indicators.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so look, the reality is we got like three years here, guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: We got like three years to really capitalize on this trend.
[SPEAKER_07]: And
[SPEAKER_07]: This is like the California gold rush right now, okay?
[SPEAKER_07]: We're living through the California gold rush right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we got three years to capitalize.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you're anything like me, look, I'm gonna go hard for three years.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going hard, okay?
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you thought these last two years I was going hard, I'm gonna be leaning in even more, okay?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm gonna be leaning in even more.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know you're shocked.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know you're shocked.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm serious, we got three years.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can work for the next five years like no one will, so you can live the rest of your life like no one can't.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's what I'm all about right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the commitment I have.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was the other C I was missing, Kevin.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was commitment and you have to care.
[SPEAKER_07]: and it's community, the context to that community, communications, content creation, consistency, conversion, cash.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a 10 Cs framework right there.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a 10 Cs framework.
[SPEAKER_07]: You follow that framework for 90 days, you will be bringing in revenue, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: You will be bringing in revenue.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, all right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Kevin, Christelle, over to you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we'll go for another like half hour here.
[SPEAKER_07]: but I just got to my destination point, so I'll be turning around here.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, it's been a great space so far, guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Please like and repost the space, would really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you guys wanna come up, ask any questions, now's your time.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're doing a great mastermind here.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, I'm serious, guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: We got three years to capitalize, okay?
[SPEAKER_07]: I've never seen anything like this in all my years of being in business.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, over to you, Kevin.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: The reason I was asking about lovable too, is like more in a personal manner.
[SPEAKER_06]: So like I see everybody building a website and is it always a good idea to really have a website?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because just in terms of my business model, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like for me, a landing page is perfectly fine.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you follow my funnel, you'll see, it's just a website.
[SPEAKER_06]: You put in your emails, boom, bada bing, bada bong.
[SPEAKER_06]: So like, is there really, I guess just based off if you,
[SPEAKER_06]: Essentially give me a profile on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Would there really be a reason for me to have a website?
[SPEAKER_06]: And if so, what would be something you could see?
[SPEAKER_07]: Featured in a website because I can maybe imagine possible testimonials Yeah, well here's the way to go about it Kevin is like You may not need a website, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're there's people on beehive alone that are making 1020 K a month without a website Okay, you don't need you don't need a website the only way you would need a website is if
[SPEAKER_07]: Prospective customers or current customers are saying, hey, yeah, Justin, I need this Revenue Ronin app because I can't afford you at $500 an hour, but I can afford $47 on demand access to your frameworks and your methodologies to drive more revenue with my marketing.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, great, I'll build that out.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you've got to ask your existing list
[SPEAKER_07]: Do they have a need for a website?
[SPEAKER_07]: Do they have a need for an app, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, don't just build an app to just build an app, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, Christelle, you'll love this one.
[SPEAKER_07]: Our good buddy, Eric, who's my good buddy, he's a fellow Ronin.
[SPEAKER_07]: He drives the Model X Tesla that we host, the Be Real X Talks show.
[SPEAKER_07]: He called me yesterday and he said, hey, Justin, I need a booking app built.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm like, dude, lovable, right, right there.
[SPEAKER_07]: So he reached out yesterday.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's like, yeah, I need this, I need this.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the point is, people will come to you and say, Kevin, I need an app.
[SPEAKER_07]: I need a ghostwriting app, or whatever.
[SPEAKER_07]: They'll tell you what they want.
[SPEAKER_07]: So find out what they want, go and get it, and give it to them.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't just build an app to build an app.
[SPEAKER_07]: Build an app that people have pre-signed up for, just like Jim teaches us.
[SPEAKER_07]: Jim, lazy Canadian, he's not just building apps for the heck of it or building courses.
[SPEAKER_07]: No.
[SPEAKER_07]: These are people who actually said, I want to pay for your knowledge.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to pay for your expertise.
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you build a course?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sign up here.
[SPEAKER_07]: He brings in 50 grand and then he builds it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like that's the way you do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the way you do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't just build to build.
[SPEAKER_07]: And let's just be really brutally honest here, okay?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just gonna be really brutally honest here, because we're on a kick today, it's spicy today.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not even Friday, it's Saturday.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm working today, so I'm in that work mode, okay guys?
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, you're gonna have to deal with it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, 80% of the websites that are built on Lovable are not gonna make money.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's just the reality.
[SPEAKER_07]: 80%.
[SPEAKER_07]: of the websites that are built on Level.
[SPEAKER_07]: 80% of all websites.
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't matter if it's on Level or not.
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_07]: 80% of them are not gonna make money.
[SPEAKER_07]: 20% of them will.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the Pareto Principle.
[SPEAKER_07]: The top 20% of all websites make 80% of the revenue.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the reality.
[SPEAKER_07]: So how can you get a sliver of that?
[SPEAKER_07]: How can you tap into that?
[SPEAKER_07]: And the thing you gotta focus on is not the app.
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't have to focus on the app.
[SPEAKER_07]: What you need to focus on is the pre-launch for your app.
[SPEAKER_07]: The pre-launch for your app.
[SPEAKER_07]: Building that list.
[SPEAKER_07]: Building the pre-launch.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what you gotta focus on.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because then, the market dictates everything.
[SPEAKER_07]: We can sit here and talk about apps all we want.
[SPEAKER_07]: But unless we have people that are interested, ready to go, on our email list, and ideally that have thrown you $50
[SPEAKER_07]: to invest in building an app that they want, that they care about it so much they're willing to put some skin in the game, which we talked about yesterday, then don't build it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't waste your time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't be among the 80% that's not gonna make money.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't be that statistic.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, it's real talk here.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's real talk.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, he's preaching.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's preaching.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's fired up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did I get my audio back?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you're good.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's fired up.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't mean to get technical, Justin, but it's actually so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually what?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's actually 95.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's actually 95% of apps have made $0 in revenue.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to say, I think Justin's being generous with the 80%.
[SPEAKER_04]: But Justin, that was absolute fire gold.
[SPEAKER_04]: um we definitely need to do something with these transcripts i know we talked about that but i'm just like omg that was fire uh yeah we need to turn it into something i'm gonna watch this video i bookmarked it i took a screenshot of it so i've got i need to do my homework when justin says to do something y'all please do it i just love your level of expertise and knowledge when it comes to
[SPEAKER_04]: not just why these tools are great.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm coming from the side of it's user-friendly, it leads to transformation, but you're able to talk about it on the level also of who they are as a company, which is huge.
[SPEAKER_04]: This perspective is so important and having knowledge of this is so important.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not just blindly and we're not blindly doing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't blindly talk about these tools.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're very careful about the tools that we recommend.
[SPEAKER_04]: But this is also how we get paid by the tools is through the credits.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to go and Grok Imagine and create some.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll give you all the credit, of course, will work for AI credits.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that what it was?
[SPEAKER_03]: That was because that's definitely the life I'm living right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Christelle, for that kind, kind feedback, and I just ran into my neighbor.
[SPEAKER_07]: She was talking to me.
[SPEAKER_07]: So but yeah, thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: And
[SPEAKER_07]: and that
[SPEAKER_07]: What is your superpower?
[SPEAKER_07]: Andy talks about it a lot.
[SPEAKER_07]: What is your superpower?
[SPEAKER_07]: And part of my superpower is really being able to bridge the gap between technical and non-technical people.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is just a really big gift I have.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is why I was teaching in workshops for small businesses at Maricosta College.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, really just lean into your superpower.
[SPEAKER_07]: And everyone has a superpower.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you don't, just ask your preferred LLM.
[SPEAKER_07]: I use like 20 different LLMs, guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, for different purposes.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a cheat sheet.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, when do I use Manus?
[SPEAKER_07]: When do I use Lovable?
[SPEAKER_07]: When do I use this, that, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's my little cheat sheet when I use each LLM.
[SPEAKER_07]: When do I use Grok, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: So have a cheat sheet, but really lean into your superpower and being able to bridge the gap between technical and non-technical people has been a really,
[SPEAKER_07]: gift that I've been blessed with.
[SPEAKER_07]: And because people enjoy the fact that, wow, you know, Justin can help translate this into layman's terms.
[SPEAKER_07]: When most people, what they do is they talk over you and they talk very intellectual and they use buzzwords.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's like, that's not how you do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You got to break it down into language that they understand, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: You got to be relatable.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't just, that's not the way you do business.
[SPEAKER_07]: The way you do business now is being able to be a bridge between technical and non-technical things.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that'll take you a long way, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: This is why I get invited to board meetings.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is why I get direct access to CEOs.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I'm able to break things down in a way that they understand.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is a superpower, guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we all have our superpowers.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you've got to lean into it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You've got to lean into your superpower.
[SPEAKER_07]: So OK, back over to you, Kevin.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh-oh.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got into a speaker glitch.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you guys hear me?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're good.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, there we go.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just spaced doing this glitchy thing as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I don't really have too much to add.
[SPEAKER_06]: But just to really consider it, too, 95% of those apps I mentioned
[SPEAKER_06]: They're making zero dollars.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, if we ask potentially how many of those apps make even a hundred dollars, which is not a whole lot of money, I think that number is closer really to 99 percent.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you really it's it's it's it's competition, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's definitely a big game.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that a lot of people are just building websites for the sake of their right to like they're not really going in with the intent of.
[SPEAKER_06]: ever really winning, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Lovable.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's cool, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Being able to make a website within, you said six hours, just in compared to even just the last year where it took people like up to words of six months, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like that is really, really a game changer.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think a lot of people are just kind of in that spark mode and it's just going to saturate the market even more and just going to have making people a lot less money.
[SPEAKER_06]: But for the people who are actually utilizing it and leveraging AI to its full potential, yeah, of course, they're going to be the ones winning here as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I like the honesty here, Justin, as well, because yes,
[SPEAKER_06]: Most people are not going to make money.
[SPEAKER_06]: Most people aren't going to add a dollar to their revenue.
[SPEAKER_06]: Even when we look at statistics, like it's, it really is crazy.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, and this is in business in general, not just websites too.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I want to add this and then we'll go to Crystal.
[SPEAKER_07]: Great points, Kevin, great points.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was talking to this business broker the other day.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's a local business broker.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what a business broker is, for those of you who don't know, he helps people buy and sell businesses.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what a business broker does, okay?
[SPEAKER_07]: And unless you've been sleeping under a rock, you know that there's a trend with baby boomers that are retiring, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Baby boomers are retiring, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like my dad's generation, my mom's generation, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: People that are in their 60s, like they're starting to retire.
[SPEAKER_07]: They have these businesses.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a boring business.
[SPEAKER_07]: A boring business is something that, it's not high tech, it's not AI, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: But some of these businesses generate significant cashflow, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: They generate great revenue.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the problem is, you still need an operator to operate the business.
[SPEAKER_07]: You still need an operator.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now I'm not gonna, you're not gonna find me working at a, running a laundromat.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, maybe I'll have someone run the laundromat for me.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the point is, is like you still need an operator to operate the business if the person is retiring.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: But but these these aren't easy businesses.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like the guy was telling me like real talk, like how I'm talking to you guys, like he was telling me real talk.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's like, Justin, you know, these people think that they can just acquire a business and it's really easy and it's passive.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm telling you, Justin, it's not like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm going to get him on the show here.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to get him on a space.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got his contact info.
[SPEAKER_07]: And because I want him to be real with me, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, there's a lot of hype out there.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of fluff.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you know, the real, I want the real stories, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Real results, real people, real relationships.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want the real talk, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: This is why my show is called Be Real X Talks, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I want people that are being real, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want any hype.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want you to give it to me raw.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want you to give me the truth, the real truth, your truth.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because the reality is, you don't know it till you live it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't know it until you live it, okay?
[SPEAKER_07]: If you lived it, then you have the right to tell me how it is.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you've never lived it, I'm sorry, I'll listen to your opinion, but until you've lived it, you can't talk to me intelligently unless you've actually lived it.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you don't, I'll give you a million dollars, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: If you haven't, all due respect, I'm a realist.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a realist.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's one thing I got from my dad.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, I'm going to get him on here because he was dropping some heat, some fire on the call that I had with him.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, I'm looking at different businesses that are baby boomers, retiring, boring business.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, how can we take this over?
[SPEAKER_07]: How can we grow this business?
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe put some AI in there, maybe not.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is what I'm researching because here's the point.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can acquire an app on Flippa, the website's called Flippa, F-L-I-P-P-A.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's websites on there that are for sale, and they're already generating revenue.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, this was another thing I was gonna mention to you, Dan.
[SPEAKER_07]: Flippa has a website that sells, buys and sells websites of people that are already, you know, they've already built out their,
[SPEAKER_07]: their websites, their apps, whatever, and some of them you can filter.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want something that's making right now between 1,000 and 5,000 a month, let's say, for example.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it'll show you a list.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, here's all the verified sites right now that are bringing in between 1,000 and $5,000 a month in revenue.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you could acquire that, you could buy that asset, and you can build it up, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you need to do to build that up?
[SPEAKER_07]: You need to acquire more customers and you need to retain more customers.
[SPEAKER_07]: Which, what do you need to do?
[SPEAKER_07]: Sales and marketing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sales and marketing.
[SPEAKER_07]: You see the pattern here.
[SPEAKER_07]: You see the pattern.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sales and marketing.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what matters.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sales and marketing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And here's my hot take prediction right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: The reality is in a year from now, probably two years,
[SPEAKER_07]: Marketing is becoming obsolete.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Shannon said it on a space, I don't know if it was this year or last year, but he said it.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's like, Justin, I don't even use marketing now.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just sales and sales support.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he's right.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's right, because it's getting so intelligent now, you only have two functions in the next year or two, sales and sales support.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Marketing is disappearing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Accounting, you know, your site, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like you have all these agents doing things.
[SPEAKER_07]: I literally had four browsers working, doing four different tasks this week.
[SPEAKER_07]: Four, four different tasks, four different agents doing different things for me.
[SPEAKER_07]: Four, four different browsers doing different things for me.
[SPEAKER_07]: So,
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, the window of opportunity is huge.
[SPEAKER_07]: Make sure you know your ICPs.
[SPEAKER_07]: Me and Christelle are really clear on that now.
[SPEAKER_07]: We know our ICPs for high ticket.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to lean into that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, definitely some good conversations today.
[SPEAKER_07]: So all right, Christelle, over to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is my audio okay?
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, we're about to go to that's Romeo.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're about to go to the pumpkin patch.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so this is perfect timing, but it's been an amazing space.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're on fire, Justin.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just talking to my client, Naisha yesterday, and she was saying, you know, entrepreneurs use the weekend.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like we love the weekend because yes, we're with our family, but we can also find times, you know, within that to do like what we've been doing here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just it's nice because I'm not on the weak grind, you know, so it's just really good stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: So good to have everyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just want to encourage people because yes, it's true that most people that have websites won't make money on those websites.
[SPEAKER_04]: But guess what?
[SPEAKER_04]: The people that learn how to use these tools will be the ones to make money in the future.
[SPEAKER_04]: These we will be the billionaires, the multibillionaires, because we know how to use these tools.
[SPEAKER_04]: So don't think so much about, you know, how much, oh boy, stuff is going everywhere, how much your website is going to make.
[SPEAKER_04]: Think instead about how much the skill of staying on top of using these tools and having it as a part of your offer stacking that we talked about this week.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I want you all to think about, because you will win if you focus on that, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Not so much how much money is this website going to make, but ask yourself, how much revenue am I going to bring in with this skill?
[SPEAKER_04]: the skill, that is where the money will come in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because then all you have to do is be creative, which you are.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just have to tap into the vision then, the ideas, the creativity.
[SPEAKER_04]: But so many people won't even be able to get there, they won't have access to tap into that because they're so focused on tool, no tool, and that's not really the point.
[SPEAKER_04]: The point is to like,
[SPEAKER_04]: have all these other pieces put together and learn the skills, learn the sales and marketing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm working with my client right now who has put, her developer put 2,000 hours into this product that does not work.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not even an MVP, but it has like 100 plus features.
[SPEAKER_04]: They overbuilt, overdeveloped.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now I'm coming in here and I'm like,
[SPEAKER_04]: I could literally build this product for you in Lovable, and guess what?
[SPEAKER_04]: If I run into something that I don't know how to do, I can think of at least 10 people that would help me, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Would get on a call with me for 15 minutes for free and help me get to the next step.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm like,
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just, I can't express to you all how valuable it is to have these skills because we are part of the .001%.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't think about the money that's gonna come from what you build.
[SPEAKER_04]: Think about the money that will come because you built it and you know how to do it and you're the rare one who actually built.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did a workshop yesterday.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had 16 people there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Only two built during that workshop.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I understand people are at work, they're at lunch, I get it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But those two people now have a skill because they actually built it because watching it being built by someone else is not, does not a skill develop.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just puts a little spark in you that's very important, but you're supposed to build on that spark and go learn something and build it yourself, hit the publish button, figure out how to get the custom domain,
[SPEAKER_04]: That is a full skill.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can now say, hey, I can do this for you and charge whatever you want to charge.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, that's it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Such a great, amazing space.
[SPEAKER_04]: An honor to be with so many of you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, much love.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope you all have a great weekend.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, enjoy the time at the Pumpkin Patch, Christelle, with Romeo and the family.
[SPEAKER_07]: It sounds like an amazing day.
[SPEAKER_07]: So enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, you work hard so you can
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, spend time with the family.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what it's all about.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, keep up the great work you're doing and not just, you know, how much revenue, but how many, how can I serve more people, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: How can I serve more people?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the real questions we all need.
[SPEAKER_07]: How can I serve more people at scale, at scale, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Lovable, the reason why they've had such incredible growth is because they're servicing a need that exists
[SPEAKER_07]: They're bridging the gap between tech and non-technical people, and they're serving more people.
[SPEAKER_07]: So ask the question for your business, how can I serve more people?
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, always great to have you, Christelle.
[SPEAKER_07]: We got extra spicy here for this Saturday.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, we'll go for another 15, 20 minutes here, guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know Christelle may have to leave.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd love to hear from anyone else.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you guys want to come up, ask any questions, now's your chance.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're having a great mastermind here between Kevin, myself, and hopefully you guys are getting some value.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what it's all about at the end of the day is, hey, am I delivering value?
[SPEAKER_07]: How can I serve more people?
[SPEAKER_07]: These are the questions that you need to answer.
[SPEAKER_07]: And start with your existing network and connections, friends, family, business, colleagues, and ask them, hey,
[SPEAKER_07]: What are you struggling with right now in your business?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I'm struggling with this and that, Justin.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, great.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me see how I can help you with that.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's your budget?
[SPEAKER_07]: What is this costing you to not have this solution?
[SPEAKER_07]: What does the next 90 days look like?
[SPEAKER_07]: These are the types of questions you need to be asking.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, over to you, Kevin.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so I actually do have a question for you, Justin.
[SPEAKER_06]: What have been your most effective channels when it comes to reaching your ICP and your targeted audience?
[SPEAKER_06]: What has worked for you?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so lately, I've gotten my newest client from Indeed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Indeed.
[SPEAKER_07]: So Indeed is a job site.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I've been scraping LinkedIn.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been scraping Indeed.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been scraping other directories of startups that have gotten funding and I've been targeting them.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, yeah, that's been a good lead source right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: But my main channels right now is like LinkedIn and X and the scraping of job sites like Indeed and LinkedIn and just, you know, doing the B2B outreach and my internal network too.
[SPEAKER_07]: um, tapping in work, getting referrals, right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Referrals is big.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've gotten a few clients lately because of referrals.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, that, that's, what's been working for me.
[SPEAKER_07]: So hopefully that helps.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, to be honest, like the, the X community and the revenue running community, this is all like X people, you know, it's all X people and it's very affordable for them to,
[SPEAKER_07]: to join the revenue growing community, obviously starts at $20.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's a great investment.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, and yeah, back over to you, Kevin, and I see we have someone coming up here.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, no, it's absolutely awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had no idea indeed was like, still really a thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've had some negative
[SPEAKER_06]: some negative moments with it as an employee, but no, it's really good that people are still leveraging it too, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, you know, leveraging websites similar to X and indeed and stuff like that too, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: They already have a customer basis and indeed is a very trustable site.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I've never used it myself, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like as a, if I'm ever in the process of needing more writers or more people on my team, it's a good way to go about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: But for me, X has always been the funnel, whether I'm, you know, taking on,
[SPEAKER_06]: contractors or if I'm just looking for employees just because you know people speak the language right like that's what's really important and that's one of the things that I look when it comes to finding my ICP do they understand that language and it's so so important so a good way to look at this as an example would be if you're selling to
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, chefs, do they understand some of the chef, you know, languages that they understand?
[SPEAKER_06]: Are they able to cook brown butter?
[SPEAKER_06]: Or if you're selling to gamers, do they understand the gaming analogies?
[SPEAKER_06]: So things like that are definitely something to really consider too, because at the end of the day, it's not just about how long, or sorry, how effective they're going to be in actually being able to do the work, but it's also in
[SPEAKER_06]: how bearable are they going to be able to work with as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: And my brother does the exact same thing in the film industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: He actually does a lot of the interviews when it comes to hiring, particularly child actors.
[SPEAKER_06]: And one of the things that they look for, and this ties into very much your ICP as well, is it's not always just about do they look the part,
[SPEAKER_06]: But are they actually going to be somebody that they're going to be able to manage and work with for a long time?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because some of these projects can last two to three months.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if they're going to be little brats, so to speak, in the nicest way possible, are they going to be easy to work with?
[SPEAKER_06]: Then that's something they also consider.
[SPEAKER_06]: Even though they may not be the best when it comes to the film, you also have to understand the actual process as well, too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Are they somebody that's going to be easy to work with?
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's something to really, really consider.
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately, right, sometimes we're put in positions where we have to be able to, you know, pay the bills first, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: You taught me this, Justin.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes we're put in two positions where we're not always able to really, you know, make decisions.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, that client or employer may be a little bit
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, frustrating to work with sometimes, but you got to be able to build your own basis, first and foremost, as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: And once you're in a comfortable position, which a lot of people don't even get to, but once you are there, then you're able to really make the decisions on who you want to hire and even if it may seem like a quality lead.
[SPEAKER_06]: in the sense of them willing to pay up if they're unable to really work with easily, then it's just not really worth your time as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: So just some also really things to consider as well, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Are they easy to work with?
[SPEAKER_06]: Honestly, that's been my number one priority before even a lot of the money comes out with.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's why I always and always, always take them on over to a call because it's not just about understanding business, but it's about actually understanding who they are.
[SPEAKER_06]: And funny story, this was like a year ago now.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had a call one time when I was closing a client and the vibes were there.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had very similar interests and it got to the point where we were on a call for two hours.
[SPEAKER_06]: We both got shirtless.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had a couple of beers.
[SPEAKER_06]: We were just kind of shooting the shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that may seem a little bit unproductive, but it created a relationship that lasted six months as their client, you know, just because it was made so much easier.
[SPEAKER_06]: So really, these things really do add up and really, really start to start considering
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, man, I wanna expand on some good points you made, Kevin.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, keywords.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you gotta be able to pick up on the keywords in conversations, especially if you're talking to a prospective client and also a prospective team member, like Kevin hit on.
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to be able to pick up on these keywords, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: So language, communication, but also keywords, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: So if I say, for example,
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, tell me about your recent campaign.
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you conduct a SWOT analysis?
[SPEAKER_07]: What was the results, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're like, whoa, what's a SWOT analysis?
[SPEAKER_07]: Whoa, whoa, time out.
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't know what a SWOT analysis is and you're in business and you're running campaigns?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, okay, that's a red flag.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a we're not moving forward to me, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: So to Kevin's point, this is really critical, not only on the prospective client side, but on the prospective team member side.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because if they're not picking up on the keywords and they're not able to speak intelligently about a particular topic in their space, maybe video editing, graphic design, fill in the blank, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Then you know that, okay, this is probably gonna be a challenge, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Part of your job as a leader is to analyze and assess the gap of learning that exists.
[SPEAKER_07]: If there's too big of a gap, then I have to basically tell them, look, I appreciate you spending some time with me.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're just not in a position right now to work with me.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I typically work with clients that are further ahead.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're at $2 million a year, looking to go to $4 million.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you're under that criteria.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the point is, you've got to be able to suss this out on your own.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's another cheat code.
[SPEAKER_07]: Superpower, it's another superpower that you develop by working with over a thousand people like myself.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm really able to suss out like, okay, yeah, there's a big learning gap here, but I can work with them, or you know what, the gap is too big.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just can't take them on as a team member or client, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: So keywords, so Kevin, great, I love that distinction.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a big one, that was a big pro tip there.
[SPEAKER_07]: So thanks for dropping that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Look, in the beginning, when you're trying to get clients, the reality is you'll take anyone.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's just the reality.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been there.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've all probably been there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes you're working for free.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes you're taking clients you don't want to take on just to pay the bills.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been there.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been there.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been to zero.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been, I've had zero in my account.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the point is,
[SPEAKER_07]: wherever you're at in your journey, you need to have your quickest pathway to profit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Your quickest pathway to profit, what does that look like?
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's most likely gonna be from a few high ticket clients, right, at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or a job you can't refuse, right, a job offer you can't refuse.
[SPEAKER_07]: Those come up too, like I recently got one, and from March to September 1st,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, in a job that I was making great money and I was still doing what I'm doing today, building my agency, building the Ronin community.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, but yeah, this doesn't stop.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like this is, this is ours.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like we're building this together, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: This isn't just about me, this is about we.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is we, and it's not me, it's we.
[SPEAKER_07]: So really big distinction there.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, and you notice that,
[SPEAKER_07]: We're all growing together, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: We're continuing to level up.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're continuing to level up.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we got about 10 minutes left.
[SPEAKER_07]: So get ready to share final words here if you're on stage.
[SPEAKER_07]: Chidera, did you want to ask any questions here?
[SPEAKER_07]: Got about a couple of minutes here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, please.
[SPEAKER_07]: No.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks so much for the value.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been on this space for, this is my second time, I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm getting a lot of value from these spaces.
[SPEAKER_01]: My question is this, when I say I'm a first time founder, this is my first time building out a digital product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I am planning on launching probably
[SPEAKER_01]: within the week.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm asking, how do I get my first customer, not even first-time customer, just their first customer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to give you a context, the product that I'm launching is an AI-powered content repurposer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm targeting content marketers and creators that are profitable, but they don't have time to manually repurpose their content.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have any, what advice for me?
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_06]: Chidera, are you doing any outreach at the moment?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I've not done any outreach at the moment.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, so that really is the big problem.
[SPEAKER_06]: We were actually talking about this earlier in the space.
[SPEAKER_06]: The way you get your first client is the same way you're going to get your second, your third, to your hundredth client, to your thousandth client for majority of the time, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: There will be some exceptions where you get referrals, or if you have a very sizable account, you can get some inbound leads.
[SPEAKER_06]: But especially when you're first trying to get your first client, this goes,
[SPEAKER_06]: I heard you were talking about some AI marketing that you're doing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think regardless of what it is that you're building, I'm in a weird position because I don't consider myself to be super hard in business.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just a premium ghostwriter.
[SPEAKER_06]: I do a lot of freelancing.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's where a majority of my income really goes from.
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, I'm open to learning about business and I'm looking to scale my agency one day.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, uh, yeah, it all just comes down to the amount of outreach that you're doing, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, people may think that I'm getting a ton of inbounds, even with this kind of size, but that's not the case.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: People are always telling them, you know, people are always just like, how many inbounds are you getting?
[SPEAKER_06]: And realistically, I'm getting one inbound one every two months.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if I were to rely on inbounds, dude, I would be dead.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would be so dead.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, a really good amount to put out there too, is just
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're looking, there's multiple ways of doing it, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, spaces are a fantastic tool because you're able to get out there and share your ideas.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that kind of warms a lot of people up.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you're going through the cold outreach way, there's, of course, emails.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you're here trying to build your way through X,
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to be brutally honest right now, this may scare some people, but send 100 DMs every single day.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm being 100% serious.
[SPEAKER_06]: Send maybe 30 to 40 of them being specifically targeted, and then send out a couple that are just more so cold outreach as well, because that has actually built up a lot of conversions for me as well, surprisingly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes you just never know, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Their profile doesn't say all of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't know them as a person of who's really behind the screen.
[SPEAKER_06]: They may need it, even though their profile doesn't really say so, but you're going to really want to produce that anyway.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the second thing is to follow up, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: What does following up look like in the process?
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'd say maybe after three to four days have really gone by, you know, don't be too annoying about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: If they haven't responded, uh, just send them a little nudge, you know, don't be too, too passive aggressive about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just, you know, a quick follow up, uh, is a fine message.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if they don't, you know, follow up and then, then just leave them alone, you know, for a while.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then.
[SPEAKER_06]: wait possibly a couple months as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I find that a lot of people, 30, 40% of their revenue often disappears by not following up alone.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it really is just a math game and numbers game.
[SPEAKER_06]: I really find that to be the case.
[SPEAKER_06]: I will always, always, always be preaching a cold outreach as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, you know, if you're, what was the example I gave earlier?
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're a stockbroker, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Those people, especially back in wall street, back in the days, people were on, we're literally calling 500 times a day.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if they were able to close just two to three deals, like those guys are bringing home multiple six figures as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it really is just math at the end of the day as well too, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there's obviously other strategies too.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't just go in there and offer a really shitty product.
[SPEAKER_06]: You gotta be able to craft that.
[SPEAKER_06]: But with AI now, you're able to get second opinions on that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's just really been my way when it comes to really getting clients.
[SPEAKER_06]: And let's just break down the math even more if you're still not convinced, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're sending out 100 DMs every single day, that's 3,000.
[SPEAKER_06]: DM sent in a month and out of 1% we're talking 1% I'm closing about 5% through cold DMS whether it's emails whatever but at just 1% You're closing three clients if those clients are paying you even at the bare minimum $1,000 a month You just made three grand your first month just by doing a lot of cold outreach as well And there's money is also really abundant too.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to make that very clear I want to start to believe that money it becomes really scarce and
[SPEAKER_06]: which is why people tend to really hold back on even doing a lot of cold outreach in the first place, you're really going to start losing too.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't care what niche you're in.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're looking to just build your newsletters and you're trying to get conversions, do cold outreach that way as well, if you must, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: There's so many ways, but, uh, we can definitely get on a space if you want.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'll talk about that a little later.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry for hogging this, um, Mike there, Justin, but I really wanted to make that point because I think it's so, so important, especially when you're first going out there too.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, no need to apologize, Kevin.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was fire, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just want to add on a couple more points here as we wrap up the space.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, if you think you're just going to post content and things are going to flood in, you got another thing coming.
[SPEAKER_07]: So Kevin just shared the numbers with you.
[SPEAKER_07]: And look, you've got to sell yourself at the end of the day, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't care what you do.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't care if you're a ghostwriter.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't care if you're a programmer.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you built this app five years ago that made a million dollars, that's great.
[SPEAKER_07]: I care about who I'm buying into as a person, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Who is this person that's selling me?
[SPEAKER_07]: Who is this person that's promoting themselves daily, showing up daily, consistently daily, putting in the work daily?
[SPEAKER_07]: Who is this person, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: If you wanna sell, if you wanna close deals, right, you have to sell yourself.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how I made a million dollars.
[SPEAKER_07]: I sold myself to these businesses that had computer problems.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all I did.
[SPEAKER_07]: I sold myself.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the byproduct to that was, hey, I happen to be good with computers as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right?
[SPEAKER_07]: So you're selling yourself.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't forget that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, like the world has completely changed and you need to be assertive, not aggressive.
[SPEAKER_07]: You need to be assertive with who you are and who you serve.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that'll take you far.
[SPEAKER_07]: And is it easy?
[SPEAKER_07]: No.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it for everyone?
[SPEAKER_07]: No.
[SPEAKER_07]: But when your back is against the wall, and you've been laid off five times, and you have a daughter, you better believe it, that this guy is gonna be stepping up.
[SPEAKER_07]: This guy right here, I'm talking about myself right now, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm stepping up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because no one else is coming to save you.
[SPEAKER_07]: No one's coming to save you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Breaking news, no one's coming to save you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nobody's coming to save you.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's real talk right there.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, all right, let's get to final word here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Chidera, final word, over to you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then we'll go to Christelle and Kevin, and then I'll close this out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks, guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: Chidera, you're inaudible right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think he's glitching.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think he's got the spaces glitch.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, final word.
[SPEAKER_07]: Over to you, Christelle.
[SPEAKER_07]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_07]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, go for it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, final word here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Any other questions?
[SPEAKER_07]: We got to close up the space.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, I don't have any questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much for everything you said.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got so much value.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll start implementing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll start implementing it, doing my code outreach.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, thank you, Kevin.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for the question, Chidera.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you guys like what you're hearing, make sure you subscribe to Kevin's newsletter, to Christelle's newsletter, and my newsletter, and just subscribe.
[SPEAKER_07]: I share weekly tips that will bring in more revenue for you.
[SPEAKER_07]: If that's something you're interested in, make sure you're on the newsletter.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sharing weekly tips every Tuesday and Thursday.
[SPEAKER_07]: You read the newsletter, you implement it, more revenue.
[SPEAKER_07]: If that's something you like, all around sales and marketing, then get on the newsletter.
[SPEAKER_07]: You should like revenue because that's my second favorite thing after profit, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: So profit first, revenue second.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, final word over to you, Christelle, and then we'll go to Kevin.
[SPEAKER_04]: You would really say, because you reminded us of this earlier, service first, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And then from there comes the profit and the revenue.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really, really amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for that reminder earlier.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm just coming in as the student and building on that because that's really what it's about.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it so much.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got so much out of this space and I hope a lot of other people did too.
[SPEAKER_04]: We even had some live coaching with Justin, which we can all learn from, definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, much love.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are on the way right now, so I'm going to make this quick and get off.
[SPEAKER_04]: Much love.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye, everyone.
[SPEAKER_06]: Much love, Christelle.
[SPEAKER_06]: Words of wisdom.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't celebrate once the money hits your bank account.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't celebrate once you get the client, celebrate when the job is over, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because that's when you know you've actually, it's yours, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's actually yours.
[SPEAKER_06]: I see too many people creating, you know, they start to self-sabotage when they start to celebrate once it's in their bank account, but that's not yours until the job is over.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some nice words of words, some nice words of wisdom.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you guys are interested in writing and learning how to monetize here on this platform through skill sets or other ways of monetizing as well, I do have my newsletter up in the, not the Jumbotron, but down in the Purple Pill.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you guys want to go check that out, please, please do so as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when you do that, you're able to support Justin as well by doing so.
[SPEAKER_06]: So thanks again, Justin, for this amazing space and welcome to the Startup Circle.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, guys, if this is your first time in the startup circle, welcome.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, a lot of love to Christelle and everyone else down below.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, this this is, you know, I'm so humbled to be part of this community, thanks to Kevin's vision.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, and he kind of deemed me as a co founder of the startup circle.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm truly humbled by that title, guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is what it's all about, guys, is we're building here, we're building our businesses, we're building our legacies.
[SPEAKER_07]: and you're in the right room.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is your first time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, hopefully you've gotten some value here and that's what it's all about is delivering massive value, delivering massive value so that you can execute and implement the teachings and bring in more, you know, results and success for your business.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, uh, just a reminder, the two biggest mistakes I made was I stopped building my personal email list and I stopped building my personal brand online for 15 years.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: 15 years.
[SPEAKER_07]: while I worked in corporate and built my agency.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so for the last two years, literally to the day, I've been all in on X and I've been just going hard on spaces and building this startup circle community and the revenue running community.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're building this together, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: We're building this together.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're on this journey together.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I thank everyone for contributing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hopefully you guys enjoyed.
[SPEAKER_07]: the scenery here at the beach as we did this Saturday sunrise bonus space.
[SPEAKER_07]: We do these Monday through Friday, 645 AM to 745 AM Pacific, so make sure you tune in.
[SPEAKER_07]: Put it on your calendar right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't wait for someone else.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just put it on your calendar.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everything starts with commitment.
[SPEAKER_07]: So commit to your success.
[SPEAKER_07]: Commit to your success.
[SPEAKER_07]: No one else is going to do it for you.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I haven't had a million dollars show up on my doorstep.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think you guys have as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so it takes work.
[SPEAKER_07]: It takes discipline.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: What was that?
[SPEAKER_06]: You're still waiting for it?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I said I would wish I wish it would just come up to my doorstep.
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be very, very nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: But at the same time, I'm kind of glad it's gone this way, because I think that the moment you become rich, I mean, truly wealthy is looking back on the work in progress you put in.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and look, getting to that first milestone of, for me, it's 20K a month, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's my milestone that I'm aiming for, and I'll hit that next year for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe sooner, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: If I get one or two big biotech clients, I'll hit that for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the point is, what is that metric that you're aiming for as far as revenue goes, and you're progressing towards that?
[SPEAKER_07]: and really get clear on that and committed to that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah, guys, just remember, I wanna thank everyone for tuning in.
