[SPEAKER_09]: So I know you're thinking, Christelle, you know, you thought it was that one, but no, it's the follow-up problem.
[SPEAKER_09]: My other favorite F word.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, but yeah, let's go through some intros real quickly.
[SPEAKER_09]: Kevin, good morning.
[SPEAKER_09]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, good morning, Justin.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's good to be back for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually got a long day today.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I won't be here very long, like literally two, three minutes, but
[SPEAKER_08]: Very, very happy.
[SPEAKER_08]: 6,500 members for the Startup Circle community.
[SPEAKER_08]: Unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's so, so amazing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Happy to see you guys.
[SPEAKER_08]: Danielle, I feel like it's been forever.
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, VB hosting them in awesome spaces.
[SPEAKER_08]: Andy, Krista, good morning, everybody.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I guess out of the two, it's more so my biggest issue is really the following up with people.
[SPEAKER_08]: It hasn't been so bad in recent times as well, but I could absolutely be better in terms of my emails, marketing and all that.
[SPEAKER_08]: But for the most part, it's been really chill.
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, I do have to get going.
[SPEAKER_08]: Unfortunately, I just wanted to come say I had to come up after hearing that amazing intro music.
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope you guys are going to have a lovely and awesome day.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll be seeing you around and take care, everybody.
[SPEAKER_08]: Have a good day.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, thanks, Kevin.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for tapping in, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: Always great collaborating on the back channels.
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, good stuff, brother.
[SPEAKER_09]: Andy, good morning.
[SPEAKER_09]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, good morning, everybody.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Wednesday, the 5th of November.
[SPEAKER_07]: Totally blew that yesterday.
[SPEAKER_07]: But today is the 5th of November.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I love the whole Guy Fawkes thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's blow up the government.
[SPEAKER_07]: Whether it's right or wrong, I love that somebody will
[SPEAKER_07]: have in their mind oh this is not right there's some injustice in the world and since nobody else is going to do it then I'll step up that's the part I like not blowing up the government don't care governments come governments go in a hundred years who knows what the land you'll be standing on right now
[SPEAKER_07]: will be covered or governed by something, somehow, someway.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's not a question of, do you get rid of this government or that government?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a matter of just being the best you can be in your situation.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why I like Guy Fawkes.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why I love the whole story.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you don't know, go look it up.
[SPEAKER_07]: G-U-Y-F-A-W-K-E-S, Guy Fawkes.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then it is raining that you know hard angry cold don't go outside All the oil will lift off the highways and there will be tons of accidents and rain and horrible it will never get Really light today here in Sacramento.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just one of those days and I'm here for it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I love it again.
[SPEAKER_07]: I lived in Egypt in Cairo for
[SPEAKER_07]: Two and a half almost three years and it rained five times while I was there five in three years So when it rains I go outside and stand in the rain love the rain.
[SPEAKER_07]: My kids were born on days.
[SPEAKER_07]: It rained.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was awesome Anyway, it's a great awesome Wednesday Yeah, happy Wednesday to you Andy and yeah, so I love the rain analogy right like like people
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know what it is in San Diego or whatever, but it's like, and this is part of, you know, I'm gonna tie it back to personal development, of course.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, you gotta learn how to dance in the rain.
[SPEAKER_09]: You gotta embrace it, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: Because the storm is gonna come and it's how you, how your attitude is, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, you know, bring it on, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: Bring it on.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, people get scared.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my gosh, the rain.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like, you know, just like life, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, you're gonna have these,
[SPEAKER_09]: things happen and you just have to, your attitude determines your altitude.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I, I posted that yesterday for Will and I always say it, but yeah, I mean just, you gotta learn how to, and people are really tested when you're really like hot water, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: A tea, a tea bag, you're really tested as you're dipped in hot water to see what you're truly made of, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: So learn, learn to embrace, you know, the rain, dance in the rain, that, that's, that's what it's all about.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: you're gonna be tested and that's okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you're gonna come out on top, that's it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And mindset and attitude is everything.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, all right, welcome Christelle to the stage.
[SPEAKER_09]: Good morning, how's it going?
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, and shout out to, is Jackie still here?
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh no, she left, but I was gonna say hi to Jackie, she was here.
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, welcome Christelle, how's it going?
[SPEAKER_09]: that the
[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got a lot of visuals going on here this morning with Andy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what, guys?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Justin, you and I are both in California, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when it does rain in California, we're like, oh, my gosh, who messed with the perfection of it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, even though we desperately always need it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Southern California, Danielle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're absolutely right on that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, like, even though I live here, and I do love the weather here, I mean, I absolutely love the consistency of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I, you know, I'm an East Coast girl, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So rain is rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And but when I think about rain, you know, let's think about water, though, you know, dancing the rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, yeah, that's, that's an old adage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's very, very true.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, almost like rain is like, oh, when times get tough, or they get unpleasant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I love the conceptually what water represents because in my mind it always goes into like the spiritual kind of realm, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think of it as cleansing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I invite that and maybe it goes back in Christelle's here, some maybe like baptism and all those things, like all the things that water represents.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't, I don't dislike, I don't dislike any of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't bring up anything bad, but I love
[SPEAKER_00]: You know in F.U.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought F.U.
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not see follow up in your F.U.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I love that you clarified and I love even more that you played with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got us going in the other direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know lead generation is I mean that's just something that I don't want to say I struggle with.
[SPEAKER_00]: but that I have to work on because it's equally important as the follow up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I used to think probably before I came into these spaces that this was all about like filling my pipeline, like I'm the lead generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, the pipeline, the pipeline, the pipeline.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, you know, when I take a step back and I look at it more from the angle of know what you're doing is you're building relationships before the sale even happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I mentally go into the relationship building mode, as opposed to like spreadsheets and pipelines, I can attach myself to that process a whole lot better, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I love that you're talking about lead generation and the follow-up is always the follow-up, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The follow-up is, you know, systematically I can get ready for things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do presentations or I'm going to go to networking events and I'll have a follow-up plan in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: eight times out of 10 before the event even occurs, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I want to be prepared.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's not really what follow-up is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not one and done, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not about like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just about the quality of the follow-up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really the quantity and the coming back and the coming back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that persistence is so necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And instead of persistence, I'll say consistency, because that word is just a little bit easier to digest, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't seem so intrusive.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, it's not just one, two or three.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the books will tell you, those business books will tell you that it takes five, maybe 12 follow-ups before you actually carry a sale or even get closer to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the consistency is key.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I love the F-U.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put an F in there and Danielle's down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wait, wait, I don't want to say Danielle's down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't that sound a little bit salacious?
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm down with Danielle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's spread the rumors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, can I just do a quick shout out to Fabio because he's down there in the listener section and Fabio and I have been doing
[SPEAKER_00]: a little work together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's just great.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is so easy to talk to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's walked me through some like little obstacles and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's just such a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_00]: He really just dials down my energy, if you can believe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you ever get a chance to work with Fabio, you definitely want to connect.
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, Fabio is great.
[SPEAKER_09]: And yeah, I'm down with Danielle, you know, that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: So.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, thanks.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks, Daniel.
[SPEAKER_09]: So a lot of great points you brought up, especially around the systematic follow-up, and we'll break that down and share some pro tips.
[SPEAKER_09]: And yeah, you gotta be persistent for sure, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: And the one and done, like you definitely run across those, but they're very rare, okay?
[SPEAKER_09]: Like they're very rare.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd say like 1% chance, maybe less than that are like a one and done close.
[SPEAKER_09]: Majority of them,
[SPEAKER_09]: are going to be multiple touch points, multiple follow ups, multiple calls, multiple texts, multiple emails, multiple meetings to get to that close.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's just the reality.
[SPEAKER_09]: Unless you're buying just like a book, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: Like your book sale should just be one and done, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: But working with Danielle or working with Justin or Andy or Christelle or Will or VB, that may be multiple touch points.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's, that's just the reality, uh, in, in a service based business.
[SPEAKER_09]: that the
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, you know, we gotta make business fun, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, we're, we're, we're so serious.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're professionals all the time, but we gotta have a little fun and, and you can do that with marketing and your creativity.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, but yeah, thanks everyone for being here.
[SPEAKER_09]: Please be sure to like and repost the space.
[SPEAKER_09]: We really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's, let's say hello to Christelle and then we'll go to VB, Patricia and Will, and then we'll get, we'll get going here.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: Morning, Christelle.
[SPEAKER_09]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_11]: Mike check, can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, you're good.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh my gosh, so disrespectful.
[SPEAKER_11]: I went to go hit the mic button and it just kept muting me.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm like, ah, but I'm happy to be here.
[SPEAKER_11]: Happy.
[SPEAKER_11]: What's today?
[SPEAKER_11]: Wednesday hump day.
[SPEAKER_11]: I love rainy days too.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know how I knew in DC I was a Florida girl because when he was pulling over on the highway because it was raining, I was still driving and I'm like, why are all these people pulling over?
[SPEAKER_11]: So yeah, I love the rain.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, Justin.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, Andy, Patricia, Will, Danielle, VB, everybody.
[SPEAKER_11]: I see Dan Ryan is here.
[SPEAKER_11]: And yeah, Danielle, I totally agree about Fabio.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's awesome.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's actually one of the original EduCreator founders.
[SPEAKER_11]: So he's been supporting us for a long time, like years now, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: So yeah, much love to you, Fabio.
[SPEAKER_11]: And okay, so two quick things.
[SPEAKER_11]: One, this title here,
[SPEAKER_11]: You know the F you I'm with Danielle because you can say it's follow up.
[SPEAKER_11]: But the way I feel hearing it feels like an F you because it's the thing that I constantly need to do.
[SPEAKER_11]: And the fact that you have this up here this morning when I was just thinking I've got like three people I need to follow up with.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm like, why are you reading my mind?
[SPEAKER_11]: Why are you in my head?
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah, it's not a lead gen problem.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's definitely an F U problem.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I mean that in every possible way, every definition, it's all of those.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, think about your relationships.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's probably an F you problem and you can figure out how you want to take that.
[SPEAKER_11]: OK, little morning funnies.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think I got a couple.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a third laugh emoji.
[SPEAKER_11]: I will engagement farm laugh emojis.
[SPEAKER_11]: Last thing I want to say.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you guys, this one's so good.
[SPEAKER_11]: I am screaming over this thing that I learned from Timo.
[SPEAKER_11]: Timo is out here teaching us the best things ever.
[SPEAKER_11]: Take your newsletter or any content, but I've been taking my newsletter, I've been copy and pasting it into Notebook LM, and it's making beautiful explainer videos.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a feature that just came out about a month ago.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a brand new feature of Notebook LM through Google.
[SPEAKER_11]: You take any content you want,
[SPEAKER_11]: Click one button.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know I love the one click.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a one click button that says video overview.
[SPEAKER_11]: You paste the content and it makes an explainer video for you.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're over here.
[SPEAKER_11]: I learned this from Timo.
[SPEAKER_11]: He's uploading it to YouTube.
[SPEAKER_11]: So now you can go to my YouTube.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're going to see my explainer videos.
[SPEAKER_11]: Ani's doing it.
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is my idea, because we're all going to be having these explainer videos that are beautiful.
[SPEAKER_11]: We need to start a Notebook LM explainer video channel.
[SPEAKER_11]: where we're all uploading our videos because it's your content, but it all kind of looks the same because it's these explainer videos.
[SPEAKER_11]: But if it's a channel for it, then people get used to seeing the same type of explainer videos over and over again.
[SPEAKER_11]: But it's Will's content.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's VB's content.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's Andy's content.
[SPEAKER_11]: It has your name.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then it has a link back to the newsletter.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's how we're using it.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm I'm over here now on YouTube on that, you know, and then leading people back to the newsletter because that's the content.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just wanted to share that with you all.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm so excited about it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I couldn't keep it to myself because, you know, we like to share these things here.
[SPEAKER_11]: So please go do this.
[SPEAKER_11]: Copy paste content.
[SPEAKER_11]: Notebook LM.
[SPEAKER_11]: Click the button.
[SPEAKER_11]: Video overview.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_11]: You've got a video and you can click the audio and you have a podcast.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's so good.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, can you share?
[SPEAKER_09]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: Crystal, thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you share maybe a link to a sample video so we can have an idea?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, they're all up in my.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're all up in my timeline, but I can put one up top if you want.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, please put that in the purple.
[SPEAKER_09]: I just made it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I just made a video thread with one, so I'll show that sweet sweet.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's that's brilliant.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I mean.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you get done doing that, can you like, you know, text message me some details please?
[SPEAKER_02]: That way I can track it down when I have time.
[SPEAKER_02]: and not lose it.
[SPEAKER_11]: The details are here in the space.
[SPEAKER_11]: Patricia, please don't make me work after the space, but text me your question and I can help you.
[SPEAKER_11]: But I just gave the details.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's notebook LM.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the detail.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just go copy paste your content.
[SPEAKER_11]: Click the button.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's right there.
[SPEAKER_11]: Audio overview gives you a podcast.
[SPEAKER_11]: Video overview gives you a
[SPEAKER_11]: explainer video.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's really that simple.
[SPEAKER_11]: I know it doesn't seem like it can be that simple, but it could not be simpler.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's so easy and good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I'll try it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll text you if I have a problem.
[SPEAKER_09]: Go ahead, Andy, and then we'll go to Patricia and then BB and Will.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I wanted to go back to shameless audacity of following up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Can we do that?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's fine.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then just pass it to Patricia, and then we'll go to VB and Will.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, if your neighbor needs something, and they knock on your door, and then you go, go away, I'm sleeping, and they keep knocking, and keep knocking, and keep knocking, and keep knocking, eventually what happens?
[SPEAKER_07]: We all get up, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: And then whatever they're asking for, we give it to them so that they can just go away and let us go back to sleep.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's, uh, that's from, uh, Luke, Luke 11.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's also good at the Bible, Andy.
[SPEAKER_11]: Cause I knew that that was from scripture.
[SPEAKER_11]: I recently, so good.
[SPEAKER_11]: So good.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, the, the, the follow then is even if you're an evil person, you give your kids good stuff, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't, if they ask for a fish, you don't give them a rock anyway.
[SPEAKER_07]: The point is follow up Even if it's inopportune even if it's shameless even if it's audacious It works So Keep following up only the people that don't knock only the people that don't provide only the people that don't continue to follow up and follow up and follow they're the ones that
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't get the they don't get the results and I did want to say hi to to to will because I do believe that he's probably getting close to Bonfire night, which is what I've never experienced it, but I've always wanted to do that anyway Because it is Guy Fawkes day.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is the 5th.
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember remember the 5th of November?
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, let's go to Patricia.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi Patricia
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, Andy, and because it is the 5th of November, and for you, remember, remember the 5th of November gunpowder treason and plot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know of no reason why gunpowder treason should ever be forgot.
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I know.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just don't want to say it all out loud because it sounds crazy hokey for me, but thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, but considering what I do, it's kind of on brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're welcome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I handled it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for me, yes, sometimes I have a lead gen problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I'm definitely guilty of a follow-up problem at times.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, if you tell me to be the one that hounds you about something, I will do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So once you give me explicit permission, I'm there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Crystal knows this, or at least she's finding it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes I have an FU problem in the other sense that everybody's thinking about, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, I get fed up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want F this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why am I putting up with it?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's definitely a balancing act for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now, I'm just focused on getting my projects done or at least done to a point where I'm happy to let them out in the world and everything else can just wait.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think right at this moment, I'm not even focused on leads so much as I am completion of building things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it makes perfect sense.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we get into this trap where
[SPEAKER_09]: when you have enough clients, you're focused on doing your client fulfillment work.
[SPEAKER_09]: So then you take your foot off the gas of generating leads, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: And then let's say, for instance, you know, I lost, you know, one client, not to performance, I just want to point out, it was they entered a slow season.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so just very clear about that.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, then you're back to the grind of trying to generate
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is why you need to have a systematic process for lead gen, a systematic process.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's got to be ongoing and it can't stop.
[SPEAKER_09]: Leads is the lifeblood of every business.
[SPEAKER_09]: companies pay a lot of money for leads.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so you gotta make it a systemized process so that those leads still come in even while you're doing your projects.
[SPEAKER_09]: Even while Patricia's doing her projects, even while I'm doing my projects, we're all doing our projects.
[SPEAKER_09]: You need to have a systemized process for lead generation.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then you need to have a systemized follow-up process as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: And just a perfect example of this,
[SPEAKER_09]: where this plays out is, I'm sure you've seen this, but on LinkedIn or Instagram, for example, you've seen some of these viral posts that say, hey, I just brought in 100K with this system.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you want the system and the framework and the blueprint for my exact system, just comment framework in the comment section below and I'll send it over to you.
[SPEAKER_09]: You see it on X as well, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: You see these viral posts.
[SPEAKER_09]: and then people comment below.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then if you're on Instagram or LinkedIn, they actually have an automation.
[SPEAKER_09]: So the second someone writes that word, that keyword, it automatically triggers them to get the framework or the blueprint.
[SPEAKER_09]: You didn't do any work.
[SPEAKER_09]: You didn't do any work.
[SPEAKER_09]: And ManiChat is one of them.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's another one for LinkedIn.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm forgetting the name of it right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: But when you get to a certain volume,
[SPEAKER_09]: When you get to a certain volume of traction, then you implement the automation.
[SPEAKER_09]: But you got to get to the volume first, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not going to buy the tool just yet because it's manageable right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: I can do it manually, or my VA can do it.
[SPEAKER_09]: But once it gets to a certain point where I'm putting out viral posts, and I'm saying me, you know, we, if we get to the point where we're starting to put out viral posts or viral threads where we need extra tools that can automate it, that's what it's all about at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_09]: But you got to get to that point.
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's the tools out there that help automate the follow-up process that send the blueprint.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's hands-off, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: And then you're communicating with them in the DMs.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then here's the pro tip here.
[SPEAKER_09]: It can even take that information and put it into your CRM system.
[SPEAKER_09]: So now you have an automated way and you have a lead and a contact that you continuously follow up on.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the next progression in the process is, hey, Daniel, I see that you got the blueprint.
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you have any questions?
[SPEAKER_09]: Have you executed it?
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you want to jump on a call?
[SPEAKER_09]: How can I help support you with this framework that you just asked for and I gave it to you?
[SPEAKER_09]: And again, it follows the model of find out what people want, go and get it and give it to them.
[SPEAKER_09]: We talked about it yesterday.
[SPEAKER_09]: Will mentioned it.
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, that's a little bit of a tangent there, but it's really important to understand that you can automate some of this stuff when it gets to the point where it's unmanageable.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because can you imagine if you got 1,000 comments, your post goes viral, there's no way in heck you're going to be able to manually manage 1,000 comments.
[SPEAKER_09]: Stuff is going to slip through the cracks.
[SPEAKER_09]: So before you have
[SPEAKER_09]: the opportunity to go viral, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: Typically, you want to make sure you have a system in place, you're ready.
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is how the pros do it, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: This is how the top digital marketers, the top internet marketers, the top thought leaders out there, this is how they do it with tools like ManyChat.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's Leadshark or something for LinkedIn.
[SPEAKER_09]: Whatever the platform is, it will help out with some of that automation.
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't implemented it for myself yet.
[SPEAKER_09]: Why?
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I'm not going viral, I'm not getting so many comments, but I am starting to test this strategy out with some
[SPEAKER_09]: content on LinkedIn and content on X just to experiment a little bit with some of this.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Patricia, for that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to go over to VB, to Will, and then we'll go to Hoops.
[SPEAKER_09]: But welcome, everybody.
[SPEAKER_09]: Good to see everyone.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hope you guys can like and repost the space.
[SPEAKER_09]: Would really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're talking about, do you have a lead gen problem or a follow-up problem?
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not the FU that you think it is.
[SPEAKER_09]: It stands for follow-up.
[SPEAKER_09]: And but yeah, great, great to have you guys aboard.
[SPEAKER_09]: OK. Who is next, Vivi?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, please.
[SPEAKER_09]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_09]: And thanks, man, for the love on the archives, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're digging deep into the archives, OK, man?
[SPEAKER_09]: Like 15 years ago, my videos, I have over 300 of them like that.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're only seeing about 100 on my YouTube channel, because the other 200 I didn't publish.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I hid.
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, thank you for the love on the archives.
[SPEAKER_09]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, I mean, that was my jam, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I stopped.
[SPEAKER_09]: I stopped.
[SPEAKER_09]: I took my foot off the gas, as Andy said.
[SPEAKER_09]: Biggest mistake I made, I took my foot off the gas while I worked in corporate and built my agency, and my personal brand and email list suffered for 15 years, guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why you see how ambitious I am and tenacious I am these days, these last two years.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the reason why.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's very clear.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's nothing else to it.
[SPEAKER_09]: VB, over to you, man.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for the support.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's my pleasure, Justin.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's less about showing your love and it's more about, let's say, me learning from you, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Learning from how your process has been.
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, the love is there, of course, because I'm learning a lot from you.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, stuff is going to slip through the cracks.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, thanks for saying stuff like that, Justin, because this is one of the reasons
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the many reasons why I joined spaces like this and yours and Will's.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I wish to be joining Christelle's and Andy's as well, but it just doesn't suit my timeline.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, I get to learn a lot of stuff like this, these phrases that I can kind of use.
[SPEAKER_05]: I also love how Christelle ties everything back to newsletters.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's nice to see that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's great to see that, honestly speaking.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that being said, a lot has been said between that and now.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a lot of points made, but mind tends to forget every now and then, if I don't take notes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, when it comes down to the subject at hand, okay, do you have a Legion problem?
[SPEAKER_05]: At this point, if you would have asked me about two weeks ago, I would have said yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you ask me now, I'd say that I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm currently working
[SPEAKER_05]: for free testimonials at this point in time.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm doing some free work with a couple of people, with two people to be precise.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm aiming for one more, three and not more than three because I cannot take up more than three at this point in time.
[SPEAKER_05]: It will eat up my time and I simply cannot.
[SPEAKER_05]: So once I have like three in testimonials in place, I can move on to paid version of whatever I'm working towards.
[SPEAKER_05]: But
[SPEAKER_05]: The first couple of days when I was trying to get this, so from the past two weeks I've been talking to you guys about shifting from product first module and now sales first module, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's when I started looking for people to work with.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the mistake I did.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was looking for people to work with.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what I was doing was in the search using, of course, the help of AI, what to search, creator economy, entrepreneurs, solopreneurs, building in public, etc, etc.
[SPEAKER_05]: You put it in the search, you find people.
[SPEAKER_05]: I sent in probably, I don't know, 50, 70 DMs in seven days.
[SPEAKER_05]: So 10 DMs per day.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, not much response.
[SPEAKER_05]: Number one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Number two, the people who responded, um, didn't give a positive feedback.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is number two.
[SPEAKER_05]: But number three is after seven days of actual rejection, I was thinking, okay, probably 10% conversion rate, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: If I, uh, DM about a hundred people, I would probably get maybe five to 10 responses, but doesn't necessarily need to convert.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was getting a little tiring.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was getting a little
[SPEAKER_05]: not ROI friendly for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: But when things worked out for me was, and when I realized the switch is simply, I'm doing the cold outreaches and people, I am researching on their profiles and I'm telling them, hey, I can help you out on this, so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can help, I can move you from point A to point B, whatever your point A is specifically.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that was still not working out.
[SPEAKER_05]: The people it worked out on were the people who actually were following me, number one, and number two, are constantly engaging on my posts.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now I've been active for 70 something days since I've been back.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are people who have been constantly engaging with me for like, I don't know, 30 a month or so.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I simply went into their profiles, people who are engaging with me, and I simply researched what they're about.
[SPEAKER_05]: went into their website what they're about and put it into my AI and AI generated something for me and I'm like hey man I can actually help you out in this are you in and trust me I mean believe it or not guys I reached out to five people I converted to that's pretty much it and yesterday I got another person commenting on asking me something about frameworks I'm going to reach out to him today hopefully I'm going to convert him but anyway I'm just saying
[SPEAKER_05]: Legion problem, not if you're building a personal brand, and if you're building a personal brand in the right way.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I can tell you with almost utmost certainty, and I've never spoken to Will about this, but I don't think he has a Legion problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: He has been hosting spaces since the time I've been on X.
[SPEAKER_05]: He knows his stuff, he's built authority in his niche, and so have you, Justin, and everybody else here.
[SPEAKER_05]: And people, I'm hosting space and people want to talk to him, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: People are like, hey man, I want to talk to you more about this.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't think Will has a legion problem over here because he's building his personal brand the right way and he's displayed his authority the right way.
[SPEAKER_05]: People are just reaching out to you and they may be warm or they may be semi-warm, but I think it's easier to come with semi-warm or warm leads rather than just you reaching out to cold leads.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's number one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Number two is,
[SPEAKER_05]: Justin, you were talking about you need to have constant flow of leads.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: But to someone in my position at this point in time where I, number one, cannot take up a lot more than three at this point,
[SPEAKER_05]: And number two, who's not yet built a product, but is on the verge of building a product.
[SPEAKER_05]: So once my product is built, absolutely, if I run a region campaign, run it for three days straight, hey, this is the product you can buy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Blah, you know, so boom, boom, boom, and keep buying it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Leads, leads, leads, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Many leads.
[SPEAKER_05]: But at my current state, I would be like, I really can't take more than three.
[SPEAKER_05]: because it will stop my other flow as well, other processes as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I understand where you're coming from.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's where I'm going to reach, but in my current state where I have to provide service and actually do a lot of work for these two people, of course,
[SPEAKER_05]: because i'm also looking to over deliver because they are my first few clients right i want to over deliver they're going to be the foundation of the next 20 these two people because their testimonials will matter a lot uh will mean a lot and so i'm looking to over deliver as well so um yeah that's that's my uh thought process over here i'm eager to hear will's opinion on whatever i said about him does he or does he not have a problem but um
[SPEAKER_05]: A little bit about the follow up stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: I understood that you tend to lose about 20 to 30% conversions that could happen if you don't follow up.
[SPEAKER_05]: follow up guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah Vivi, yeah thanks for the yeah great share Vivi, thanks for the tips and your your mic was getting a little bit roboty uh there towards the end maybe the the juice is getting low on your speakers or in your headset there but um but yeah I definitely picked up what you were putting down and yeah like it's I think it's important to
[SPEAKER_09]: meet people where they're at, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's like for you, some pro tips for you is just quality over quantity, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: So we have a constant in sales and marketing alignment, we have a constant challenge between quality of leads and quantity of leads.
[SPEAKER_09]: So
[SPEAKER_09]: You know you're in position right now you want to focus on more quality and those are some great numbers for the outreach and the reason why you got so successful with that outreach and response rate is because you.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're already warm right there you have to understand the temperature level of the lead.
[SPEAKER_09]: Is this a cold, warm, or hot lead?
[SPEAKER_09]: You have to ask yourself that question, and you have to do a little bit of due diligence, which is what VB is doing.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's doing a little bit of due diligence, so then when he connects, there's already A, a bit of a warm interest, and then B, he's coming over the top and really getting the attention.
[SPEAKER_09]: And showing them that they care that he cares and wants to help provide that transformation and then that's critical, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: And really, you just focus on quality versus quantity.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that that's that's the takeaway.
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, you're doing all the right stuff, Phoebe.
[SPEAKER_09]: Keep up the great work and.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for tapping in here.
[SPEAKER_09]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Always good to see you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Guys, make sure you're following VB.
[SPEAKER_09]: He hosts spaces in the Startup Circle as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're a little early for me, but definitely check it out.
[SPEAKER_09]: Always love being in VB spaces and Will's spaces.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's jump over to Will real quickly.
[SPEAKER_09]: Will, how's it going?
[SPEAKER_01]: Good morning, Justin.
[SPEAKER_01]: 18.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, really, really well, actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was loving the conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Andy went ahead and opened a big can of worms when he started quoting Luke to me, because that's my favorite book in the Bible.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the parable, right, and this also ties into what both Danielle and VB were saying about persistence.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know Danielle said she preferred the word consistence to persistence.
[SPEAKER_01]: But consistency means the same behavior repeated over and over again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Persistence is the same behavior repeated over again, even when it's hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I want to show you guys, because this is one of the stories, I'll be very brief, where this is super practical, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: When you take what it says in the Bible and you look at it through the lens of present day practicality.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the way I look at it is the friend at midnight is the story from the Bible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for anyone who hasn't read it, there's the story of a guy who's hungry and he goes to a friend at midnight and knocks on his door until that guy comes out and gives him bread.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the friend is like, no, leave me alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in bed with my family.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to come out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the guy persists.
[SPEAKER_01]: He keeps persisting.
[SPEAKER_01]: He keeps persisting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Jesus concludes the story by saying, ask and it shall be given seeking you to find, knock
[SPEAKER_01]: and it shall be opened unto you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we look at it from a practical perspective, what the story represents is the outer man, the one knocking, doesn't have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the conscious mind that doesn't have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're seeking the thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The midnight represents the moment between the states.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the world is asleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: The results are invisible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're doing the work, but there's no results.
[SPEAKER_01]: The old self has nothing left to give at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yet, if you persist, if you keep going in faith that it is granted unto you, you get the bread, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that means, of course, many different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It means money, it means whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the idea behind it is that you persist without evidence, and that is true faith.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's so practical when you think of it through that lens, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And Neville Goddard, who really interpreted the Bible this way, the first I've ever heard of doing it, he said he succeeded because of his importunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: because of his refusal to accept denial the seeming denial so you keep going even when you don't see the results because you have faith that you are doing the work and the work will yield the bread so i love that story and it's really practical in business i do teach people that with the coaching i'm like here's how you can use it the other thing i wanted to
[SPEAKER_01]: The touch on was to VB's point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guys, and I, this is probably me not being a very optimal business owner.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never sent a call to yet still as to today, I will be changing that because I have a stack of offers to produce now, which I've got tested and market ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: But up until this point, all my clients are inbound.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one of the things I do have an issue with VB, and I'll just be off, but I'll be completely transparent here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a real problem capturing testimonials.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was something within me for the last year when I first started this, back last September, that really had a problem with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was doing a lot of free work, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Much like you were doing as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was following Alex Homozy's plan, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do a bunch of free work, help get people to tell you where it sucks, and then make it better.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had no problem with that side of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for whatever reason, there was an issue within me, which I have now managed to overcome, you'll be happy to hear, to gain testimonials.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have five to six really solid case studies, but I could have had about 100 testimonials.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've worked with over 100 people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was on me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's an area I could and am now stronger at.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the benefit of it is even before that case, I was able to persist.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you practice it more and more and more and you get more and more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like for me following up with testimonials was a big thing, I'd asked for someone they wouldn't do it and I would let it go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was because of that fear of the follow up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is something I've actively been working on over the last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the beautiful thing is you have to go through that overcoming of the fear.
[SPEAKER_01]: My current brand, if I was to put it at something, it started off as you guys remember as being heroic, which I still stand by.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want you to be the hero of your story.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want you to be an NPC running somebody else's programming.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is still the goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now I look at it as becoming unshakable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which means that nothing outside of you gets to change your internal state.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I helped solopreneurs build unshakable self-confidence and I had to be the leader.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to be patient zero, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to be the one to hold the standards.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I looked at myself and be, well, you're not holding the standard here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what I worked on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So bit of a detail there, but it does tie back into the follow-up for the space because yeah, you're going to need to follow up, not just with sales, but for also for testimonials.
[SPEAKER_01]: and when you look at it as you gave value and you get value back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in fact, what I'll do is I'll put myself on the line right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was inspired by a guy called Drek, who I met the other day, really nice guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You met him on YourSpace, Justin, I think, or VBSpace, rather.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he had a stand store, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was beautifully laid out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I want one of these.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I built one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will give away a free £75 consultation in exchange for a testimonial.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's an offer available to everyone, help you get crystal clear clarity and build unshakable self-confidence.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there you go.
[SPEAKER_09]: OK, I'm going to take you up on that, Will, so I'll be the first to volunteer.
[SPEAKER_09]: You got it.
[SPEAKER_09]: So holding myself accountable.
[SPEAKER_09]: And yeah, I mean, I appreciate you being vulnerable in the space, Will.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's what it's all about in these masterminds is, you know, you've got to be vulnerable, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: Like you've got to check your ego at the door, come into the space, be vulnerable, be coachable.
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is the way you grow.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, if you really want true growth, that's what it's about.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, go ahead, VB.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, Justin, can I respond?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted to respond to Will.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's RoeBody again, VB.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's RoeBody again.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope I'm audible now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's better.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Will, I'm kind of surprised about your testimony and story because, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems to me that, this is just a third perspective over here, but it seems to me that people will be willing, more than willing to give you a testimony as well as
[SPEAKER_05]: people on the stage over here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I would give Christelle, Andy, Justin a testimonial, of course, if I took service from them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, from you as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I think your service and your product can be extremely pain or problem solving, their particular problem solving.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they would be more than willing to give you a testimony.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's number one.
[SPEAKER_05]: But number two, it tells me a lot that
[SPEAKER_05]: Even though people would be willing to, they wouldn't know to give you a testimonial because it wasn't asked.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's a lesson learned.
[SPEAKER_05]: In terms of you not doing outbounds so far and inbound has been your game, I would recommend kind of, I feel that you should still continue with the inbounds because I feel that your energy and your
[SPEAKER_05]: Your time will be better spent in you creating beautiful stuff that you already do and just be creating more and probably when you get the chance to, you can delegate the stuff to do the advanced stuff for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably just delegate the work.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe you can expand, get one, get one.
[SPEAKER_05]: someone in your team, I guess, you know, once.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just feels like it's not your style to do the outbounds.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that just feels like I'm just telling being honest over here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you should just stick to your style, what aligns with you, you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, 100%.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, here's the thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a I'm not against I mean, I was in sales for 20 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did a summer job on top of my job in broking, cold calling for window insurance.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done door-to-door sales.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was a Jehovah's Witness, remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went door-to-door when I was 10 years old trying to sell religion of all things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got no problem without them, but my problem, and I'll just be completely transparent here, I didn't know what problem to solve, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I had this grand aspiration that people out there in the world are running programming that they didn't put in their own head, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't decide that they wanted to have generational limiting money beliefs.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't decide that they were afraid of exposure.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were running other people's scripts, go to school, go to work, retire, die, that's the script.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was running it myself and I saw so many people wasting their entire life doing the script.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just came onto Twitter because I was fortunate enough to break out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I retired and I'm like, I need to do something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I met Justin quite early into the journey.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, you've kind of seen everything I've done along the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: It started with accountability because that was the biggest problem I could see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: 80% of people quit because they give up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's try and solve that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I went into, I went hard on coaching and I got certified and became a hypnotherapist.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I started working with the subconscious and that was much more impactful, but I still didn't know what problem to solve.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't niche down because there's so many problems to solve.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it wasn't until maybe three months ago, four months ago that I really nailed it in like identity is the highest leverage point.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have an identity that limits you, no amount of hustle and grind will get you past it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just can't because you'll always, you'll always self-correct to where you believe you belong.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's only really since then that I've had the ability to say, I help this person with this problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now I help solopreneurs gain an unshakable self-concept through identity shifting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't do that before.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was my bottleneck.
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew I could help people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been coaching people for 10 years in corporate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew I could get results, but I hadn't had the lens through which I wanted to share that with the world in a way that was fulfilling for me and also impactful for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is the reason I didn't do outbound, because it's like, hey, I can be your friend, but what service do I offer?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you need?
[SPEAKER_01]: And no.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for me, it was a case of let's get my hands in the clay, refine what I do, talk to people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did over like 100 free coaching sessions here on X.
[SPEAKER_01]: refine what I do, find out what people need.
[SPEAKER_01]: And ultimately, as Justin says, get good at giving it to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where I'm at now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now I have a suite of products that I've built on the back of that, that are actually helping people and actually changing their lives and actually getting testimonials now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that I think was my missing leverage point.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I can save everyone a year, it's just do more earlier, fail earlier, fail quicker, get your hands in the clay earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: And don't worry about looking like a fool because you will.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do sometimes, but I wear it well, so it's all good.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the idea being that the faster you get in there and find out what works and what doesn't work, the faster you can refine it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's probably my biggest lesson for the last 18 months.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, start with an imperfect plan and just chip away at it until it looks like the way you want it to look like.
[SPEAKER_09]: And would you say also, Will, that positioning is part of that as well?
[SPEAKER_01]: Massively.
[SPEAKER_01]: Massively.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you think about like, cause we've talked about this, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Positioning is presenting the offer in a way that the customer wants it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the best way I've heard it said was people need broccoli, but people hate broccoli.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what do you do?
[SPEAKER_01]: You wrap the broccoli in bacon and you give them that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like you sell them what they want and you give them what they need.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just to put this into my lens and my perspective, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: What people need is an identity shift.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they don't believe they can succeed, they'll not succeed.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can have all the money, all the information, all the strategy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if they aren't the person who's able to hold that success, they'll lose it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we see this all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what people actually want is more money, more freedom or peace of mind, more confidence.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I give them that, but then I deliver it via a deep subconscious identity shift that allows them to hold the result.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they get the peace, the passion and the profit and what they really want as well, which is fulfillment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's what they really want, but you can't sell fulfillment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have found you have to sell the steps that they think fulfillment is behind.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then only when they have it, can you pull back the curtain and say, Hey, it was you all along.
[SPEAKER_09]: I do have an idea for you for putting like, you know, the analogy or the visual will of like, putting that fulfillment into like a bottle, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's like, there's a play on campaign there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, I'll share with you my idea on the back channel.
[SPEAKER_09]: But
[SPEAKER_09]: There's something there, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: Because, you know, there's the snake oil salesman, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: And all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: You play on that, and then it's like the bottle of fulfillment, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's the fulfillment potion.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's like something like that.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I'm going to leave it there.
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, Will, I love positioning.
[SPEAKER_09]: The same thing happened with me on the Revenue Ronin, guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: Positioning is everything.
[SPEAKER_09]: I hired a positioning coach.
[SPEAKER_09]: because I was stuck.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was really good at sales, really good at marketing, generating millions of dollars, 100 million, over $100 million.
[SPEAKER_09]: I calculated it.
[SPEAKER_09]: You take all my employers, all my clients, I generate over $100 million, okay?
[SPEAKER_09]: And it wasn't until I got positioning coaching that really things shifted for me.
[SPEAKER_09]: So very along the lines of what Will is saying, and positioning is very powerful.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you nail the positioning.
[SPEAKER_09]: That that can be a game changer for you and your personal brand and your business.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we'll maybe talk about that.
[SPEAKER_09]: in the upcoming space.
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, thank you so much, Will.
[SPEAKER_09]: Really great share, and yeah, really great conversation.
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope you guys are learning as much as I am here today.
[SPEAKER_09]: Some very powerful insights and wisdom here.
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you, Will, for that.
[SPEAKER_09]: And yeah, just keep up the great work you're doing, Will.
[SPEAKER_09]: You want to have that problem, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: You want to have the problem of too many leads, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: Then you have wait lists.
[SPEAKER_09]: Then you have, hey, look, I'm only taking
[SPEAKER_09]: You know 2 more clients.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now I was taking 4, but now I'm down to 2.
[SPEAKER_09]: I only got 2 more spots left.
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you want to use this as leverage in your marketing?
[SPEAKER_09]: You're not lying.
[SPEAKER_09]: What you're doing is you're positioning yourself based on your bandwidth and how you can maintain the quality of your service delivery at the same time.
[SPEAKER_09]: So people know where you're at in your journey and this is important.
[SPEAKER_09]: So OK, let's jump over to hoops now and then we'll go to Patricia and yeah, welcome to the stage guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you can just keep it to about 2 minutes, would really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're kind of winding down here.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, actually, before we go to hoops, I want to go to Christelle first, because she's got to leave.
[SPEAKER_09]: So let me go to Christelle first.
[SPEAKER_09]: She can do her sign off and then we'll go over to hoops and Patricia.
[SPEAKER_09]: OK, Christelle, over to you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_11]: OK, yeah, I'm here for a few more minutes.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not quite ready for a sign off, so I'll just say have a one of your hump day.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm yelling at Manus right now because it gave me updates that are not from the past 48 hours, but I'm trying to be nice.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I did erase the exclamation mark and changed it to a period.
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah, it's been a great conversation.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I love hearing from you and just all the growth that you're sharing with us.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I love that you guys are hosting.
[SPEAKER_11]: You and VB are hosting spaces here in the startup circle.
[SPEAKER_11]: We have them all day now, starting with Justin's
[SPEAKER_11]: My favorite.
[SPEAKER_11]: I love it so much.
[SPEAKER_11]: And Andy's all about branding, which I love, too.
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.
[SPEAKER_11]: So, yeah, I'll be here, but I'm looking forward to hearing from Patricia and Hoops and seeing you all in these X streets.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm going to be following up today.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, my goodness.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to be following up.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks so much, Christel.
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to make sure you got your final word in here.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry I'm a little early, but yeah, all good.
[SPEAKER_09]: And thanks for the LLM, notebook LLM alpha.
[SPEAKER_09]: That was definitely something I'm going to be checking out.
[SPEAKER_09]: And yeah, let's jump over to Hoops.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hoops, how's it going?
[SPEAKER_06]: Good, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Morning, everybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hope everybody's doing well.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hope you all had a little workout this morning too, you know, I've already anyway I won't go into what I've already done, but it was kind of crazy I'm sitting here trying to cool off.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, great room man, as always I appreciate you guys this oh Man, this has been a an awesome impression on me and I really appreciate this room And and your community Justin and what you you guys your Nandi and Christian all you guys are doing I I did check out notebook and
[SPEAKER_06]: LM again, um, because of crystal and I like it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's, um, it's a pretty good, uh, software to use.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, um, I can verify that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Also Manichat is wicked.
[SPEAKER_06]: Manichat is awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, Justin was talking about that earlier.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why I'm talking about it now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, I've been using it for a lot and, uh, yeah, it's great.
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, you can post anything.
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't have to be an ad.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're using Manichat, um, for people to tap into your services.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's a good thing for you know, anyone who wants to advertise or just post and get some feedback get people to opt-in on projects on Instagram, I'm not sure where else manage that might be used because Instagram is a product of Meta I'm not mistaken.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't know if meta is using their own thing or they might be using that for something as well, but I'm not sure but Another platform I want to talk about a little bit too and I don't know if there's any really AI creators in this room who
[SPEAKER_06]: who are looking to really get content out there.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a platform that I've been on for a little while.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I've spoken about it a little bit here, and that's huge.
[SPEAKER_06]: The views that we're getting on Huge is crazy now because the platform is young.
[SPEAKER_06]: My videos are averaging 1,000, 2,000 views, getting up to 10,000 views in like four or five days, 10 days.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's a great thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I really feel, and my follow base too, I really feel that by the end of probably
[SPEAKER_06]: seven months from now I'll probably be at 100,000 followers.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think anybody here can do that on that platform.
[SPEAKER_06]: They also have a marketplace where you can market your videos and put a price on them.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're also paying a bonus to create an account and upload three videos on that platform.
[SPEAKER_06]: So anybody who's looking to expose their AI content, I really feel that's a good platform that you could tap into.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a link that would offer that $50.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you go through Huge, you won't get that bonus, but you get everything else.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, so I just wanted to talk about that a little bit because I'm having a lot of fun on that platform and everybody on that platform is having a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think if anybody here taps into that, yeah, you'll have some fun too and you will grow and grow and grow.
[SPEAKER_06]: So anyway, appreciate you guys loving this room.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, thanks, Hoops.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just put two and two together.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm so slow on the draw here, but make sure you guys check out Hoops' new newsletter, The Athletic Entrepreneur.
[SPEAKER_09]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm slow on the draw here because I was like, who is this?
[SPEAKER_09]: Athletic entrepreneur that's recommending me on beehive.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's hoops.
[SPEAKER_09]: Duh.
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you hoops for that man.
[SPEAKER_09]: Really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's what's cool about beehive is you can recommend other creators newsletters as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: And yeah, thank you for that hoops.
[SPEAKER_09]: And yeah, keep up the great work you're doing.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, build your empire, build your digital assets.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, it starts with the newsletter.
[SPEAKER_09]: It starts with your personal brand.
[SPEAKER_09]: It starts with positioning and your positioning can change, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: It can mature.
[SPEAKER_09]: And as we've seen will play out for many of us creators here on this platform, the positioning changes, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: And you just got to roll with it, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not wrong.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not wrong.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just you find out what people want, you go and get it, you give it to them and they tell you, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, Justin, you need to be doing more sales and marketing, not just marketing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like you need to be doing more sales.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, great.
[SPEAKER_09]: So now sales and marketing mastery.
[SPEAKER_09]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: What's next?
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is the feedback loop and there's no failures.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just feedback.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Over to you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Go for it, Christel.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I just have to say, oops, I'm I'm so excited that you're you know, you're doing this and you're sharing.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I actually totally forgot what I was going to say because I just saw Timo's message.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, you are.
[SPEAKER_11]: I got to constantly give credit to Timo.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I want to give credit to everyone that teaches us how to do something, even though we've been hearing about it for a year and we don't do it.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then it just takes someone in the community to be like, look, guys, I did it.
[SPEAKER_11]: And look what it did.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I do it, or Ani does it, or Hoops does it, and then we're just loud about it.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, we come on stage and we're like, I don't care what the topic is, I just need you all to know that we are using this tool and this is how we're using it.
[SPEAKER_11]: But yes, it was Teemo.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was Teemo.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to be loud about the fact that it was Teemo that got me.
[SPEAKER_11]: to actually go into notebook lm after hearing about it for over a year because he jumped on the video piece that's the new thing you all and look if you sleep on this i'm sorry for you because he basically figured out an app notebook lm is a study tool okay it's not a
[SPEAKER_11]: AI video generation tool.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's not what it is.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a study tool that has this button to create an explainer video because it's a study tool.
[SPEAKER_11]: And here we are as creators.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks to Timo for charting the path and leading the way.
[SPEAKER_11]: He had the brilliant idea, oh, I can turn my content into an explainer video and then download it and upload it on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, we can all do that.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then once you start doing that, you might get addicted like me and clip up the videos, turn it into a thread.
[SPEAKER_11]: I posted up at the top.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's so much we can do with this, guys.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you're building courses, use it to create the videos for your courses.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, please hop on it.
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah, thanks, Hoops, for shouting me out.
[SPEAKER_11]: I got to give credit where credit is due.
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah, I'm going to be loudmouth about this now.
[SPEAKER_11]: Get used to it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks, Christelle.
[SPEAKER_09]: And yeah, good luck on the follow-ups today, and close some more deals.
[SPEAKER_09]: And yeah, that's what it's all about, is the fortune is in the follow-up, guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: And just make sure you have some basic systems in place.
[SPEAKER_09]: And yeah, wishing you continued success and greatness, Christelle.
[SPEAKER_09]: Keep up the great work.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for being here.
[SPEAKER_09]: OK, let's go over to.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it was Patricia who had her hand up and then we'll start wrapping up here.
[SPEAKER_09]: OK, Patricia, over to you.
[SPEAKER_09]: OK, I can't hear Patricia.
[SPEAKER_09]: You may want to take a lap real quick, but yeah, let's check back in with Andy and.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, go for it Andy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, this is a great conversation.
[SPEAKER_07]: I love the idea that we're, okay, we've said a bunch of stuff, but what we're really doing is creating a piece of content and then repurposing that in all the different channels.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the reason that's important is because all of the fish
[SPEAKER_07]: who want to buy whatever you're selling or whatever you're offering or maybe just consume your content.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not all in the same place.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some are on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some are on TikTok.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some are on your blog.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some are on your email list.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some are on your X feed.
[SPEAKER_07]: What you want to do is you want to capture them wherever they are.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then ask them if they're interested to be part of the things that you can manage and control forever.
[SPEAKER_07]: Your blog and your email list and everything else is rented space on somebody else's platform that can just shut you down anytime they change the rules.
[SPEAKER_07]: So take your content.
[SPEAKER_07]: Make your content the best it can be.
[SPEAKER_07]: Publish it, repurpose it, and use it everywhere.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's what we've been talking about today.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that will help you solve your lead gen problem.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because remember, you don't fish in the desert, even if you have the perfect boat, and the perfect life jacket, and the perfect pole, and the perfect hooks, and the perfect bait.
[SPEAKER_07]: If there's no fish in the dry lake in the desert, it doesn't do any good to have all the cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: You got to take the cool stuff and throw it where the fish are.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, makes sense.
[SPEAKER_07]: Go where the fish are.
[SPEAKER_07]: Fish where the fish are.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, yeah, well said Andy and and I want to bring your attention to the pin post here because you know Andy's really inspiration for this content system as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to highlight him because I like to give credit where credit is due and so you'll see here that during the month of like September and October I had significant growth on LinkedIn.
[SPEAKER_09]: 332 percent to be exact on impressions and 392 percent on engagements.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can see the graphs right there from LinkedIn.
[SPEAKER_09]: Why is this?
[SPEAKER_09]: Why did this happen?
[SPEAKER_09]: So this happened because I finally put together my exact system of recording a Zoom video, taking the transcript,
[SPEAKER_09]: and creating pieces of content from that transcript, 14 specific pieces of content for 14 different platforms to be exact.
[SPEAKER_09]: Then I basically 10x'ed my output, my volume, my consistency, and obviously the quality was there.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's what happened.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the results were three booked calls, one paying client, and one hot prospect in the process of hopefully closing next week.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's the report.
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you want that exact strategy, you know, comment Ronan and I'll add you to the wait list for the revenue running content revenue syndication system as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe be calling it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know I'm fishing here, but we'll see what happens.
[SPEAKER_09]: But but yeah, Andy's Andy's been a huge inspiration for you know all this stuff coming together as far as my content syndication system and really just.
[SPEAKER_09]: Having me formalize it with my own tool stack that I have access to, and then I did meet with John Carlos yesterday briefly.
[SPEAKER_09]: On a call, which was awesome, we did a video call briefly and he gave me some additional insights as well about utilizing some other tools.
[SPEAKER_09]: So look, you can use whatever tech stack you want or any any toolkit you want, but but the main thing is just to remember that you gotta do more.
[SPEAKER_09]: You gotta increase the volume.
[SPEAKER_09]: You gotta increase the frequency, the consistency, and everyone who's commenting now and engaging, I gotta go in and do that work, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: You can't just post and ghost, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: Because when people are liking your stuff and they're commenting, they're showing interest, and then it's up to you to follow up.
[SPEAKER_09]: right to follow up and not everyone's going to be ready to sign up and that's OK.
[SPEAKER_09]: But you will find that 3% rule.
[SPEAKER_09]: I always talk about 3% of people are ready to buy what you have right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: 3% the other 97% of people need to be continuously nurtured and no just means not right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: But if they do fit your ICP, your ideal client profile, there's a high likelihood that when they can afford you,
[SPEAKER_09]: you will be the first that comes to mind.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's exactly what's happening now.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm getting the results and the traction and really just amplifying everything and doing more, just 10, 20Xing it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And yeah, the reason why you want to also incorporate videos, right, and Hoops and Christelle mentioned it, is because the algorithm favors videos.
[SPEAKER_09]: It favors it.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you're doing videos, incorporating videos into the algorithm, into your content strategy, this is going to be helpful.
[SPEAKER_09]: A perfect example of this, just to put a pin in this one.
[SPEAKER_09]: So Spotify I uploaded about 20 something episodes of my podcast to Spotify, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, same piece of zoom content.
[SPEAKER_09]: I just download the MP4 file.
[SPEAKER_09]: I upload it to Spotify.
[SPEAKER_09]: So now I have a podcast and then I added it to Apple.
[SPEAKER_09]: Apple podcasts as well automatically so.
[SPEAKER_09]: When I started, I didn't know this, that you can actually upload videos to Spotify, not just audio.
[SPEAKER_09]: So then I uploaded five videos.
[SPEAKER_09]: So those Zoom videos, I uploaded them to Spotify and guess what?
[SPEAKER_09]: Guess what happened?
[SPEAKER_09]: The metrics improved because it's favoring video over audio on Spotify.
[SPEAKER_09]: So these are little small indicators that you wanna pay attention to.
[SPEAKER_09]: because you want to, and this is why TikTok is so powerful with video, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: So long story short, incorporate, it's all testing at the end of the day, marketing is all testing, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: But the ultimate driver is revenue.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then on top of that is profit.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if things aren't equating to revenue, then you got some work to do, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: Myself included.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, um,
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, let's go to Hoops here, and then we'll go to Netta, and then we'll start winding down the space here.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, thanks guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: Go ahead, Hoops.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think, I saw Will's hand before mine's.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't see Netta, but I think Will's hand was before mine's, I think.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, yeah, go for it, Will.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks, Hoops.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, go for it, Will.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I was just going to respond to Andy about the video and the repurposing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yesterday guys, I did something I've never done before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I repurposed one of the daily videos I do for the school community into a short, which I posted here and on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and it was actually, I think you got like 300 views in the first hour or so on YouTube, which was wild because I've done one YouTube short in my life before this, and they got like 80 views.
Um,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it was just really interesting because I took something that I made for the community.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for you guys in the community, you see these every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I was like, well, how can I repurpose this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause this is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is good stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm proud of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I went into CapCut and they've got a feature called longs to shorts and they'll just chop it up and put it automatically into short.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just uploaded one of those and I'm in the process of doing another one right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes like two minutes and then you can put that in, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: in your distribution channel and it'll put it out there for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, I've been practicing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I just wanted to speak to that and it actually got way more views than the one I did intentionally.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I'm not sure if that's just me being in flow or what, but it works.
[SPEAKER_09]: And Will, I want to put you on the spot here if you don't mind.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, would you mind doing a testimonial video for me and I'll do a testimonial video for you?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd be happy to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we've all learned lots from you in these spaces.
[SPEAKER_01]: And though I can't make the lives in the revenue-running community, I do see the value in those conversations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So absolutely.
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks, Will, for being open to that.
[SPEAKER_09]: And do you have a space today as well before we go to Hoops?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll do a quick plug.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please do that plug for the speakers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So startup circle one hour and four minutes from now, we're going to be talking about the internal game, how to stay unshakable when life and business gets messy, because it's not a question of if it is a question of when.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's all about how to stay unshakable while you're playing the long game.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's coming up in one hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Avni, I and our special guest Aubrey are going to be covering all things in a game.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, see you guys in an hour.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, please post that in the Purple Pill, Will.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll try to make that if I can, but, you know, some client fulfillment duties, which takes precedence.
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, definitely post that in the Purple Pill, Will.
[SPEAKER_09]: Would love to.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's one of my favorite spaces as well, Will's Spaces, guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I like a lot of your spaces.
[SPEAKER_09]: I like Christelle Space.
[SPEAKER_09]: I like
[SPEAKER_09]: Timo's face, Andy's face, I like them all.
[SPEAKER_09]: But thank you again, Will.
[SPEAKER_09]: Always, always appreciate your friendship and the value.
[SPEAKER_09]: And yeah, keep up the great work you're doing.
[SPEAKER_09]: OK, over to you, Hoops, and then we'll go to Neda, and we'll sign off here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, just quickly, just wanted to speak to the video situation again.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you are right.
[SPEAKER_06]: The algo favors videos.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I guess that's one of the reasons why I went to film school.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, yeah, because you know, I can, I can, well, the value from that was just crazy because
[SPEAKER_06]: video rules.
[SPEAKER_06]: And right now we're sitting on the platform with probably the best AI video tool, Grok.
[SPEAKER_06]: Really and truly, Grok.
[SPEAKER_06]: Man, because I've been using all these tools, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been running because this is what I do, the films thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: So testing these tools is what Grok is doing now, Grok and Sora.
[SPEAKER_06]: But Sora is another platform.
[SPEAKER_06]: But Grok, and the thing is,
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm now I'm telling five second stories and 10 second stories, but I stick to five second stories.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are getting great traction on my new account on, um, on, on Tik TOK, but here as well, you'll probably, you'll get that traction too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and we're, you're talking about videos.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so easy to spin that up and create a video that speaks to your brand.
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, and learn to tell little stories that speak to your brand.
[SPEAKER_06]: For example, you look at the little video I have pinned on my profile.
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll see how that speak to my athletic entrepreneur brand.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm really learning how to continuously speak to the brand without speaking to the brand, if you understand what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_06]: And videos have done an awesome job of that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've created a hundred
[SPEAKER_06]: of these little five second videos and 10 second videos already because they're so easy to create.
[SPEAKER_06]: uh, compared to my one minute and five minute videos, right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or 10 minute videos that I do for clients and other purposes.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, that the grok, man, grok is awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: The quality, the speed, the voiceover, you just got to put VO for voiceover and it's going to get a voiceover you want.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I'm really, yeah, so I'm excited about grok.
[SPEAKER_06]: I never, I never thought I'd be this excited about grok, but.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah man, learn to tell those little short stories that speak to your brand and have some fun with that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, so hoops.
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to challenge you to something here on the video side and I want to do this myself too.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you know, maybe for November we can do this, but you know, Jim.
[SPEAKER_09]: Our good friend Lazy Canadian here, you know, he always talks about his blueprint for how he's making 30k a month.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's real simple guys, just to remind everyone, 10 videos a day for 2 years.
[SPEAKER_09]: 10 videos a day for 2 years.
[SPEAKER_09]: One year, I think.
[SPEAKER_09]: Wasn't it one year?
[SPEAKER_09]: Or is it two?
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's two years, yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I mean, if we can do it for a year, you know, I think.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then it's driving people to his email subscriber list and then, you know, giving value, of course, with his lead magnet.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then, you know, now he's making 30K a month because of his course that he sells on financial education.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, but I want to challenge you.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you can do like if you can upload for the November, like I don't know how many videos based on your scheduler that you use or manual uploads, but I want to try to upload.
[SPEAKER_09]: like 50 short clips over the course of the next, you know, month, 50 short clips on TikTok and X, mostly TikTok and X. Instagram, for whatever reason, I'm not getting much traction there and I'm hitting it hard, but it's just, I mean, I've had much more success so far in views and, uh, traction on X and, um,
[SPEAKER_09]: and TikTok with my videos, but with those short clips, I think, you know, you should try to do like 50 over the course of a month and see what happens organically.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, you know, yeah, I'm on that journey now, Justin.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just started that, that new tick, my new TikTok account for at Lake Honshimi, or, and I already got your 16 videos up there in two days.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm trying to keep up that schedule.
[SPEAKER_06]: In two days, there's 16 videos and the highest video has 380 views right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Most of them have 200 to 300 views.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, that's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_09]: nice okay well yeah let's keep it up and by the end of this month november we'll be checking back in in this room here you'll hear it guys and we'll be seeing what type of traction we're getting and here's the correlation that we want yes we want views but we also want newsletter subscribers and then we want ideally revenue and and deals coming from this as well so that's that's the intention right so everything
[SPEAKER_09]: These are indicators that lead up to the revenue, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: So everything is a clear indicator.
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, good stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: OK, let's go to Netter real quickly and then we'll go to final word here with Andy and myself.
[SPEAKER_09]: Netta, how you doing?
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for your patience.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much for having me.
[SPEAKER_03]: So very quickly, what I will be doing for unfeathered is we have a subscription to restream.
[SPEAKER_03]: And after we finish hosting our spaces, we're going to play this space from our desktop.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we will be recording the screen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we'll be uploading that to YouTube and Spotify and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to let you know, it's better to do it after.
[SPEAKER_03]: We tried to do it during the space live, but it's so buggy and unstable that we thought it's a better idea to do it after.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_07]: Install Meld Studio, create one screen, put it up as the screen with the audio capture, turn it on, hit record, and then go to your browser and do your thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll record everything.
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't have to do it twice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good, I can second that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Andy.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there are other tools as well, but that one's easy and free and it's very simple to set up.
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome, yeah, yeah, good stuff, Neta.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, really, really appreciate all your contributions, Neta.
[SPEAKER_09]: And yeah, we can always improve on our content system.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's for darn sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, just look at the, you know, how many times Andy has been teaching us and, you know, we've all been teaching each other here on this journey of, you know, two years.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, we're in two years and one month here for me on X on this platform.
[SPEAKER_09]: And coming up on a year of spaces and in case you didn't get the memo.
[SPEAKER_09]: But we're going to be doing week weekday spaces in 2026 again for another year.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't know if you heard that memo, but now you've heard it breaking news and just some additional bonus here.
[SPEAKER_09]: For the Ronan community, so even if you're on the $20 plan, the 97 or 197.
[SPEAKER_09]: it doesn't matter, you'll get access to the monthly bonus, ask the revenue Ronin anything office hours.
[SPEAKER_09]: So whatever plan you're on, it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_09]: As a bonus, now moving forward, what I've done is I'm gonna make a lunchtime spot where you can hop on a call with myself and whoever wants to join, but you have to be a Ronin member.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's gonna be a Zoom call once a month.
[SPEAKER_09]: around lunchtime pacific time you can jump on a call with me ask me anything you'll have an hour and that's what you get as a bonus as part of your plan moving forward so um i'm sure fellow ronins down below are going to be happy with that also prospective ronins uh guys get get on the ball here prices are going up in 2026 i'm just going to be honest with you right now
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, the time constraint here is getting.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, larger so, but I want to make sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I want to give people the opportunity to, um.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, invest in what we're building together here.
[SPEAKER_09]: This isn't about me.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's about we.
[SPEAKER_09]: The mission is 1000 Ronins, so we've had over 30 people join.
[SPEAKER_09]: We'd love for you to be number 31 and to continue supporting the mission and supporting the journey of what we're building here so.
[SPEAKER_09]: OK, with that, let's go to final word over to hoops, Netta, Andy, and then I'll close this out.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you can keep it to a minute, guys would really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_09]: OK, hoops over to you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Final word.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, distribute your energy throughout the course of the day, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: You're working hard.
[SPEAKER_06]: You might be lacking a little sleep.
[SPEAKER_06]: You might be this, you might be that, but it's always, it's distributing that energy throughout the course of the day.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very important and getting that little rest, those little naps, they work.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're in an office, uh, might be a little tough to do, but you know, you can always get up and do some stretches, you know, do some squats, you know, keep that energy moving a little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there you go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Signing off.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, always a pleasure having you hoops.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks so much man.
[SPEAKER_09]: And when you get to San Diego, I gotta get you on the be real X talk show.
[SPEAKER_09]: And yeah, Danielle is next on my list and shut up to Dan Ryan.
[SPEAKER_09]: He was the first ever be relax talk show.
[SPEAKER_09]: Participant and he was the first ever Ronan to sign up.
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you so much Dan.
[SPEAKER_09]: Your support means the world.
[SPEAKER_09]: And yeah, it's always great to see you really enjoying all the content I've been seeing from you.
[SPEAKER_09]: It brings joy to my day, so thank you, Dan.
[SPEAKER_09]: OK, Neda, final word over to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we are here building ourselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are here to build products for others, but you say in the process of getting there, I think this is very applicable to me after some messages I've received over the past two days, choose yourself, build yourself first, uh, instead of building others, build yourself first, choose yourself first and don't be,
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't feel bad and don't think that it's selfish to choose yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that this is really sinking in very deeply for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And don't be scared of asking for help.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think the person who's hearing this, he's in the listeners.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to say thank you for being so supportive of me.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Choose yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't be afraid of asking for help and build yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good point.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good point, Netta.
[SPEAKER_06]: And because, yeah, because if you're on an airplane, which I fly a lot, if there's ever any problem and those masks come down, what have you been told?
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, you got to put yours on first.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got to put yours on first before you can help anybody else.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that really resonates with me, Neda, because in my past IT business, I really sacrificed myself for the company and ended up getting into a not so good financial position.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll just say that.
[SPEAKER_09]: So had I put myself first, right, which is what I should have done,
[SPEAKER_09]: I may be better off today than I than I am now.
[SPEAKER_09]: So yeah, this is this is all great stuff here.
[SPEAKER_09]: Great wisdom that I thank you for sharing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, we can't help others until we help ourselves first and we get into a position where.
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, we're strong, we have a strong foundation, a strong baseline, and then we can help more people, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: We have to help ourself first before we can help more people.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so, yeah, that really resonated with me.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you so much, Netta, for that message.
[SPEAKER_09]: Andy, final word over to you.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got an extra bonus time.
[SPEAKER_09]: I love it today.
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait, let me check with the boss.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah, I'm the boss.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, yeah, we can go another minute.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, Andy, over to you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you have a lead gen problem or an FU problem?
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably both.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, name one company in the world that doesn't want more leads.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll wait.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that's right.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't hear anything either.
[SPEAKER_06]: Every company.
[SPEAKER_06]: Even Alec Hermosby wants more leads.
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: The king who can produce more content and more results than anybody else still wants more leads.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you have an issue with leads, everyone has an issue with leads, it's just a matter of how many you're getting.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're getting some, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the new person you meet, the new follower, whatever, that's a lead.
[SPEAKER_07]: You just want more of them, that's fine.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just keep coming.
[SPEAKER_07]: Each day we're gonna talk more and more and more about sales and marketing.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the whole funnel, it's a lot.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you wanna get somewhere where you are not able to get to right now, it means you probably have to learn something and become some better version of yourself to get there.
[SPEAKER_07]: So just follow us, keep coming, you keep showing up, you're gonna get all of that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's gonna chip away at the shells, chip away at your mask.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just easier if you do like what Will said, throw the mask away, fail as fast as possible, figure out all the things that you can do to go forward.
[SPEAKER_07]: And frankly, the easiest way to find the forward path is to try, oh, that one failed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, eliminate that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Try, okay, that didn't work.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, this doesn't, oh, that one kind of worked.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, more of that.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Go till you start to succeed and then double down.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, thank you Andy and thank you everyone.
[SPEAKER_09]: Great great contributions here as always in the in the startup circle community and the revenue running community.
[SPEAKER_09]: Really appreciate everyone's contributions.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hopefully you've gotten some value out of this mastermind this weekly daily mastermind we do on sales and marketing mastery.
[SPEAKER_09]: And why is it sales and marketing?
[SPEAKER_09]: Because those are the two biggest business drivers of any company.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't care what company you're in.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sales and marketing is is the true.
[SPEAKER_09]: Revenue generating activities that every single company needs and that that's why we've committed towards mastery and it's just been.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's hard to believe how far we've come here from my old IT days.
[SPEAKER_09]: I used to be an IT guy, Microsoft, Cisco certified.
[SPEAKER_09]: You would think I was happy being an IT person, but I wasn't.
[SPEAKER_09]: At the end of the day, I had a great run, made a million dollars in five years, bootstrapped my way through business school running a company.
[SPEAKER_09]: I just lost that passion, that fire for IT and transitioned into digital marketing.
[SPEAKER_09]: And why?
[SPEAKER_09]: Because that was the new Wild West that I was curious about and committed to.
[SPEAKER_09]: And because I also saw a problem in the marketplace with my existing IT clients.
[SPEAKER_09]: They all had websites.
[SPEAKER_09]: but it wasn't generating revenue for them.
[SPEAKER_09]: It wasn't generating leads.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so this was the genesis of my first marketing agency back in 2009.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm still on that same journey right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm still committed to the craft.
[SPEAKER_09]: committed to helping businesses bring in more revenue through digital marketing and sales.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's the path that I'm on.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's been a great journey.
[SPEAKER_09]: Worked in corporate, helped make millions of dollars for companies and clients.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's our turn now, guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's our turn.
[SPEAKER_09]: As Ronins, it's our turn to forge our own path here.
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is why we attend these daily spaces, because we're building our empires, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: Because Ronins are entrepreneurs at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's what we're building together.
[SPEAKER_09]: So stick with me, stick with everyone here in this room, continue the journey with us.
[SPEAKER_09]: And just remember at the end of our lives, we'll ask ourselves four simple questions.
[SPEAKER_09]: Did I live?
[SPEAKER_09]: Did I love?
[SPEAKER_09]: Did I matter?
[SPEAKER_09]: And did I make a difference?
[SPEAKER_09]: Until next time, keep making a difference, build that mind, build that body.
[SPEAKER_09]: build that business, build that bank account, and most importantly, build that legacy.
[SPEAKER_09]: So stay hungry and stay humble.
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll see you guys at the top.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you want to keep growing, check out the Revenue Ronin community.
[SPEAKER_09]: I will put the link in the purple pill in a second, but make sure you join today.
