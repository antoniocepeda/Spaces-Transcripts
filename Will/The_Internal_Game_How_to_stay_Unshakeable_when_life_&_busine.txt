[SPEAKER_00]: Hello and welcome, everybody, to another episode of The Internal Game.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome, Avni.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome, Trish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome, Aubrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me go ahead and get you up here as a co-host.
[SPEAKER_00]: Avni, how are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm absolutely fabulous.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm feeling a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've had a bit of a sore throat.
[SPEAKER_09]: But, Patricia, I'm so confused.
[SPEAKER_09]: How did you beat me to Will's space?
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I knew exactly what time it was, and I just hopped right in here.
[SPEAKER_11]: I told you I'd be here right on time.
[SPEAKER_09]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_09]: She did it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I don't get it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I usually am the first one here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you'll just have to be a little bit faster next week, Ebony.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's go ahead and get into today's conversation, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is episode 10 of season one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have two episodes left in this season.
[SPEAKER_00]: This session is one I'm really excited about, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we're going to talk a little bit about how to stay unshakeable, which is my favorite topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the goal here is to talk about business as a long term game.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because life, as I've said in the tweet today, life and business are going to get messy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no way around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: For every up, there is a down.
[SPEAKER_00]: For every ying, there is a yang.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as part of that, we have to be
[SPEAKER_00]: unshakeable in the face of those ups and downs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that doesn't mean we have to be unmovable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just means we always spring back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've got so much I want to dig into today.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is where, this is particularly helpful if you're in the early stages of business, where you haven't yet gone through all the ups and downs, and you want to get some ideas of the bottlenecks you might face on your journey, this is the room to be in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Avni, what are your initial thoughts?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you could also please introduce our wonderful co-host.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, well, first off, let's introduce Aubrey.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, Aubrey.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a beautiful angel.
[SPEAKER_09]: She can be a little bit shy, but I'm hoping today she is going to bless us with her voice as much as possible.
[SPEAKER_09]: Aubrey, would you like to say hi?
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not sure if Aubrey's glitching or if she's actually become very, very shy all of a sudden now, Will.
[SPEAKER_00]: Might be a glitch, actually, because I can't see
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_00]: I barely heard.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a very robotic, but hello.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the space.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, please take a lap because you're definitely coming in super robotic that I have no idea what you said besides come back in.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I was going to say spaces have been super, super glitchy today, so who knows what's going to happen, but it's OK. We'll roll with it.
[SPEAKER_11]: When it gets messy, what do you do?
[SPEAKER_11]: Right, Will?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what a great way to frame it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tying it into the space already.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're four minutes in and we've had our first practical.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the goal today, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the agenda.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to talk about the difference between short-term gratification and long-term gratification.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to hit it from a different angle than you're probably thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to talk a little bit about the true goal of business, which is again a little different to what you might be thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I want to talk about developing this mindset, this long-term game mindset, because
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a great example, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at the stock market and if you're in crypto, which I know several of you guys are, when you look at the day charts or the hour chart or the four hour chart, it's violent.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the ups and there's the downs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you zoom out over time, those charts normally go up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at the Dow Jones over the last couple of decades, very violent upturns and downturns.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you zoom out,
[SPEAKER_00]: On the average it goes up and this is one of the mindset shifts I want to help you guys adopted it but not just hear about it I actually want to help you live it through this conversation today so let's go ahead and kick off having I normally send over some talking points but.
[SPEAKER_00]: My council chatbot is a little bit on the fritz today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to go off the cuff with no talking points, and we're just going to go directly into the conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to start off with, we'll tie this into X, right, because a lot of you guys are growing an account on X, growing a social media presence.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to start talking about how this works for you guys when we look at the goal of the game, as Dan Coe says, as the ability to keep playing instead of to win an outcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Avni, over to you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, here's my question, and we can tie this into X very easily.
[SPEAKER_09]: What are habits that keep you grounded and focused on the bigger picture?
[SPEAKER_09]: Because those habits help us remain unshakable and keep us from being messy.
[SPEAKER_09]: So Will, what are things that we could do that would potentially help us in our X platform or just in life, in business, to remain unshakable in those moments?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I've got a few answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: First thing I'd like to do is welcome Katosh to the space.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great to have you here, my friend, as always.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also see Netta.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see GrowthStack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guys, come on up to the stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's make this an open conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone is welcome, as always.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, first of all, let's define our terms, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Rhetoric 101.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, what do I mean when I say unshakable?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my preferred word for describing the state of internal validation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So somebody who is, we'll call them shakable for now, is at the whim of their circumstances.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they don't close a client, they get angry.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they do close a client, they get happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in both cases, they allowed the external situation, a neutral circumstance to influence their state of mind, their being, their state, their identity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody who's unshakable goes to exactly the same circumstance, exactly the same situation, and yet they're able to maintain the awareness of this is simply a circumstance and I get to define what it means about me, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I make a lot of videos for the community and I'm starting to post them on X as well, talking about this idea of awareness because oftentimes this is the only thing that we lack.
[SPEAKER_00]: it's the difference between spiraling and losing a day or a week to, you know, feeling not good enough, going into a, we'll call it a downward spiral, a death circle, or the difference between shaking it off and getting back into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I actually heard a really good way of framing this from Alex Homozy, and I can see Andy's just joined the room, it's like I flew the black signal, because Andy and I are both big Homozy fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: So
[SPEAKER_00]: He said something really interesting, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That mental toughness, you can call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a big fan of that word, that way of framing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the idea here is it has three parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to grab the notes from the video I made that he put out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he said that you need three components, and they are toughness, fortitude, and resilience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I'm going to add awareness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is how Alex views it, and he's a, in his own words, sort of cosmic irrelevancy subscriber, that nothing has any meaning and in four generations we'll all be forgotten.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a very different view, but this holds true in both cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first of all, toughness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now toughness is how long is your fuse?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many things can you take before you have a difference in performance, right, a difference in behavior?
[SPEAKER_00]: as defined by him.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next step is fortitude, so is when your fuse eventually gets burned out, how deep is the drop?
[SPEAKER_00]: So how much do you drop back into all behaviors?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then thirdly is resilience, and that is how quickly do you get back to baseline.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we can look at it through that lens of behavior.
[SPEAKER_00]: I much prefer to put it through the lens of the state, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Your state of mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody who is truly unshakable knows that no matter what is going on outside there, the circumstances, the market, things out of my control, I have 100% control over my inner world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I call this sovereignty, being sovereign of yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is truly the 1% skill that I believe all the greats mastered.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the ability to see rejection, to see the outside world tell them something, and to be like, no, actually, that is a neutral circumstance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I define who I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is being internally validated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big, long answer, Avni.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope somewhere in there you found the answer to your question, but I think it's really important to set the scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from my perspective and unshakable entrepreneur is not somebody just to be very clear who has less problems we're all gonna have problems at every stage of our journey we always gonna have preferred and non preferred outcomes it's inevitable it's a virtue of being human.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you have all the money in the world now you're running out of time if you have all the time in the world you probably don't have enough money and if you have both of those you might need impact on meaning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's always going to be preferred and non-preferred.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fact of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need it to be that way, by the way, because if we had nothing but fulfillment, if we had nothing but preferred, we wouldn't even know it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's the contrast of the downs that gives the ups their meaning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Avni, I want to throw it back over to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Given what I've just said, let's break this down for people who are maybe just starting out on their business journey, people who are new entrepreneurs, because it's a very tumultuous time.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of your identity is wrapped up in a change process, becoming somebody who goes from maybe an employee to an entrepreneur, or maybe a student from an entrepreneur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to get your perspective on this, and I'd love to go ahead and welcome some of our speakers to the stage as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Neda.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got Trish, we got Dan von Jackson in the room as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing stuff to have you guys here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feel free to come on up if you want to add to the conversation, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go ahead and make this a discussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Avni, over to you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, before we can make this a discussion, you know what we should be doing, Will?
[SPEAKER_09]: We should be pressing the arrow up top, DMing some friends, popping us in those group chats, even touching the button down in the right-hand corner, giving it a like, a retweet, tagging three friends because we all know
[SPEAKER_09]: They should be up in here right now because they're not right now up in here.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you are a listener and you can't jump up on stage, feel free to jump in those comments, drop your questions, and we will read and answer them for you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, Will, you kind of answered my question, but I also feel like I have no idea what habits I should be doing then on the X platform if I am an entrepreneur trying to make myself and establish myself here.
[SPEAKER_09]: What are the things that are positive for us and what are the things we should probably be avoiding that can get business messy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, business is going to get messy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to try to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are always going to be things outside of your control, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So even if we just look at right now, if you're in the crypto space and you've not got your McDonald's hat out just yet, you're probably aware that there's been some very significant, we'll call it, turbulence over the last few days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, some people are immediately going to go into survival mode.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to see their portfolio get cut by a third, and they're going to immediately start to think, oh my God, what's going to happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I going to have to change my plans?
[SPEAKER_00]: Will I be able to exit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Should I sell?
[SPEAKER_00]: Should I buy?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to go through their heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I want to make you guys aware of is that the initial thoughts that your egoic mind is going to come up with are completely normal, because it's a survival mechanism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think of it this way, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You are consciousness.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are awareness.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have an egoic mind that is tied to your body.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's little voices that say, hey, you'll never do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my God, the world is crashing.
[SPEAKER_00]: What that is doing is telling you, get into a fight or flight state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Protect yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're in danger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the ability to become unshakable is the ability to recognize that, to say, okay, my body is displaying a fear signal.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shows me that either I'm pushing my boundaries or it's picking up on something in my environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me go ahead and act from a conscious point of view with that information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me respond and not react.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one of the best habits that you can develop, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a meta habit, meaning it's universally applicable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to get you an individual result, but it is one of the single greatest quality of life and business enhancers there is, is the ability to be aware of the state that you are in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, let's talk about what happens if that doesn't happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if somebody is in a situation, let's say they go ahead and pitch their first client, and they get a hard rejection, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then their brain is going to go ahead and log that as a data point.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna say, when I pitch people, I get rejected.
[SPEAKER_00]: This means this about me, because again, it's always relating that the goal of the ego, its job is to look at you, look at the world, and show you where the threat is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you see somebody rejecting you, ooh, ah, that hurts my ego, that hurts my, you've heard that word, right, that hurts my ego, that hurts my perceived ability to continue living.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to break it down to the hardware level.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're a very advanced consciousness in a very, we'll say, animalistic body.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has these tendencies that, if we're not aware of them, can make us act in very irrational ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, somebody tries something and they fail.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've been hard-coded by school to fear failure, even though it's like the best learning technique there ever was.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we do something, it fails.
[SPEAKER_00]: We log that as a data point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the next time we go to do it, the brain is preloaded that data point, and that becomes the filter that we see the world through.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now it's like, well, last time this failed, this time will probably fail too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this is all below your conscious mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're off thinking about Netflix or whatever, while your brain is doing this prediction.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a prediction machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the more you allow these data points to get into your subconscious without becoming aware of them, the more you build momentum in that direction, the bigger the library of data that your brain has to pull from, the more convicted you are in the certainty of the outcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this leads to people saying, business just isn't for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is not the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Business is neutral.
[SPEAKER_00]: Business is for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Business is simply solving problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: But your brain doesn't care about objective reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no objective reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's only your subjective reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And your brain will create the filter based on your experiences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you are unaware of the associations it's making, it will color your reality through a lens that will then self-perpetuate itself because we must be congruent with our identity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is why that is the best habit you can start with, awareness.
[SPEAKER_00]: From there, you can deliberately choose your state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me get Avni back up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we've had a few spaces issues today, but let me go ahead and get you back up here as a co-host, Avni, so I can see if I answered that question.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the way, let's go ahead and welcome some friends to the stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we've got Katarzyna on stage, we've got Fabio, I can see we've got a new speaker here as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Demeji, great to meet you and have you on the space as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anyone has a
[SPEAKER_00]: question.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anyone has anything to add to the conversation, go ahead and pop your hands up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to hear some additional perspectives on this idea of starting out and remaining unshakable when business does what it always does, which is give us plenty of waves to surf, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So Dimitri, I can see you've got your hand up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go to you first of all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to meet you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Startup Circle and welcome to the internal game.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello everyone.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi Will.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm always
[SPEAKER_06]: entrance places with you there, so it's nice to finally have a conversation with you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope you're doing well.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, everyone.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, Avni.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanted to ask a quick question, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I'm a B2B social media strategist, and one of the major problems that I help them solve is not just predictable pipeline and the revenue.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's more about retention.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what do you think of the best
[SPEAKER_05]: our policy is for startup B2B stars to help retain retention with their customers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does make sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm probably not your guy for an answer though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I focus on the internal side of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have some experts though in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys want to answer that, pop on up.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I will tell you Dimenji is, how do you retain anybody with a service?
[SPEAKER_00]: You give them a result that they're happy with and confidence that that result can continue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we're looking at it and I'm going to look at it through the lens of psychology.
[SPEAKER_00]: When somebody hires anybody for a service they're looking for a solution to the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the likelihood of them buying it from you is their likelihood of perceived success, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They think that you can help them do the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a retainer or somebody who's on a retention plan, we'll say, is somebody who has agreed to work with you with the understanding that they're very likely going to continue to get that outcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, here's where we can relate it to today's topic, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The operator, and I always say that if you're in business, if you're self-employed, you are the operator and your business is the operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have the best operation in the world, but if you are an uncalibrated operator, the business is constrained by you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're the bottleneck.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if somebody is doing work for a client, and I'll speak from my experience, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone's doing work from a client and things are going the way they're going.
[SPEAKER_00]: The external world is doing its thing, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Markets are down, they're not getting the traction they wanna see.
[SPEAKER_00]: What some people will do is they will react to that situation, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They will bend to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll be like, okay, this is happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me go ahead and get defensive because that's what the brain is gonna do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me see how I can shore up these weaknesses, shore up these deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all the brain really cares about is that you're safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a really big problem in business.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fantastic if you're in a physical situation, but it's not great when you're in business or you're trying to build long-term financial wealth.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why I call this a long-term game.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the brain is going to try and do all these hoops to do what it knows works when, in truth,
[SPEAKER_00]: what usually needs to happen in that situation is an objective look at the strategy and the likelihood of perceived success of any potential changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, Mosey says that every change you bring into a business has about a 20% drop on operational performance based on something that's already calibrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, to your question, I would say,
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're providing a retention service to somebody, your primary goal is always going to be to keep that client happy by showing them, not just telling them, but showing them
[SPEAKER_00]: that there is certainty in the predictability of the outcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you don't control the external circumstances.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I would do in that situation is let's say something, and I'll use Trish as an example, right, because I promised her a book, and the book took me longer than I imagined to write.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the things I was doing was I was consistently just saying, hey, look, this is going to take a bit longer than planned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's where I'm at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's how I'm planning to solve it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had several things come up outside of that project that have also delayed it slightly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, very upfront and just say to your clients, hey, look, here's the situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what we're going to do to solve it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the predictability of the likelihood of the outcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a SAS guy, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wouldn't be able to speak to the specifics.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I am a psychology guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a human guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am an internal game kind of guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can tell you that what that client is looking for is safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're looking for assurance.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're looking for, am I safe giving this person my money?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it likely that that money is going to come back to me?
[SPEAKER_00]: If the answer is yes, if they have a high degree of certainty that you are going to provide them with an outcome and they feel safe in your hands, then they will retain with you for as long as that feeling remains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I do want to throw this to anybody in the audience who has a more specific answer for Demeji, specific to his question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Avni, let me throw it to you and then Aubrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if Aubrey wants to go first, let's go that way.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I definitely wanted to quickly check in with Katosh because I noticed his hand popped up earlier and I'm just curious if he had anything to add and if not, we could quickly go to Aubrey, see if she's back with us and then Patricia.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, everybody.
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, yeah, I guess I'm not exactly clear on the full question.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um,
[SPEAKER_08]: to provide an answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's check in then.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, Dimash, I sort of answered it from the human perspective, from a psychology perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you have anything a bit more specific related to the internal side of things you wanted an answer on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or did you want something a bit more specific in terms of the actual business side of things?
[SPEAKER_00]: In which case, I might refer you to one of our other amazing spaces that we have every single day here in the Startup Circle.
[SPEAKER_00]: But first of all, let's check in with Dimash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did I answer your question?
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, absolutely you did answer my question.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because even before I asked, I already had an answer in my head, a strategy that I used, and I'm more of a psychological guy than a functional guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was really, really in line with what I was saying, because at the end of the day, the people that you do business with are people, and people often have tendencies.
[SPEAKER_05]: People have the ways they think, the way they process things, which are more emotional than people would like to admit.
[SPEAKER_05]: So whenever I work with my clients or I'm writing content for them, I do make sure that the psychological aspect is more, what's the word I'm looking for?
[SPEAKER_05]: are more important than the functional aspect of the SaaS, of the product, because people don't buy what you sell because they think you're better than the next person.
[SPEAKER_05]: They buy what you sell because they think that you get them more.
[SPEAKER_05]: or that using your product does something for them more than the other person's own.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's say, for example, how a lot of people would rather use an Apple product than use Samsung, because even though Samsung offers more functionality, objectively, but they would rather use an Apple product because of the psychological value to use an Apple product.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think you really, really did a great job answering the question here.
[SPEAKER_05]: But just again, the question I asked was, how do you retain clients in a B2B SaaS environment?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and I think authenticity goes a long way.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think if you have a good product, and then you come at it very honestly and open, and just like Will said,
[SPEAKER_08]: Communicate with your client to let them know, you know The progress you're making if you're falling behind you just communicate that um, yeah that definitely builds the trust and authenticity to You know make them feel comfy and then the product will speak for itself, too.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I do think that's That's a good approach to just you know be authentic and honest and you know, you don't want to sell a a crappy product anyway, so
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, yeah, that's my two cents.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll add one more thing before we go to our next hand, because I can see we've got three hands up at the moment from three wonderful people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to just quickly talk about this one more angle from the psychological perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, B2B, of course, you're dealing with people who are a little bit more removed from the capital.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not their money.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I used to work for a bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: I closed $55 million in sales, but that was predominantly not my money.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was predominantly the bank's money.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea, though, here is when you're dealing with B2B, it's not quite as emotional.
[SPEAKER_00]: as it is when you're dealing with solopreneurs especially because that is their baby, that's their blood sweat and tears.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I would add is the nervous system, right, confuses uncertainty and lack of clarity with danger because it could be wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humans inherently don't like making decisions because decisions can be wrong and no one likes being wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I would say is the more
[SPEAKER_00]: Open you are with somebody the more clear you are with somebody cuz it's clarity over everything else to begin with you wanna say he is exactly where we are okay here's a bottle necklace coming up we estimate this this and this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if this happens here's what is our plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: What that is doing is it is solving for a lot of those danger points, those potential thoughts that that person could have of how can they handle it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this happens, if you can preactively solve, and this is just like sales, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's preactive objection handling.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can preemptively solve a lot of that person's
[SPEAKER_00]: concerns or predictable pain points you're going to allow them to rest in the knowledge that you are in control of the situation that's going to increase the level of trust which is going to decrease their level of stress and that is a feeling that is very hard to beat in business when somebody makes you feel at ease.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to call it safe in my hands because I used to work for TSB and that was one of their models but
[SPEAKER_00]: It really is that feeling, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I make somebody feel that they're safe with me?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they're going to get the outcome and they're going to be okay while they're getting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because just to my point, right, I help people with something that's naturally uncomfortable, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Identity shifting, behavior change, changing the lens through which they see the world, that requires the old version to die.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't die easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So
[SPEAKER_00]: When I'm going through this, my primary concern is, OK, we're going to have to do some work that's going to be uncomfortable, and I'm up front.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say, look, this is not going to be a comfortable process, but you're safe with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to guide you through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And any questions, I'm going to preemptively answer them wherever I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully that answers the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Avni, I'm throwing it over to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you pass it to our next speaker, please?
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yes, I can.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to run over to Patricia.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm actually kind of curious because I feel like we're kind of going down this route right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: But how are we handling setbacks without losing confidence?
[SPEAKER_11]: Hmm.
[SPEAKER_11]: But today, at least, you know, I'm I'm working.
[SPEAKER_11]: I am productive.
[SPEAKER_11]: I am doing the things that I have been working really hard to get better at.
[SPEAKER_11]: and i know that like through no fault of my own through no fault of anybody's things have gotten a little bit messy today and you know i'm just trying to stay focused minute by minute and it's hard to not lose that confidence because i know that when i've done these projects before
[SPEAKER_11]: If something doesn't work, my immediate response is to tear down whatever the online presence that was associated with it is and rebuild it.
[SPEAKER_11]: And here I am doing that yet again.
[SPEAKER_11]: But this time, I have people that I have told they get to see it this week.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I will go hands off it for quite a while.
[SPEAKER_11]: I did not promise them I would go hands off it, but I'm telling you now, I will go hands off it for a while and let it sit and let it work.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's making me nervous, but at the same time, I can't do anything if I don't get it out there.
[SPEAKER_11]: So, and the one thing I've been focusing on lately is
[SPEAKER_11]: being productive, staying calm, being successful.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so I can't do that if I don't put this out in the world and let it go for a bit.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so it's definitely tricky to keep the self-confidence up, but I'm trying.
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, Avni, did I answer your question?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, you did.
[SPEAKER_09]: I just didn't expect you to have an answer so quickly.
[SPEAKER_09]: So now I'm just pondering on how I make you not have an answer as quickly.
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe Katosh could take the mic while I figure out a way to make Patricia more stuck.
[SPEAKER_11]: You will learn that's not possible.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hello, Avni.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hello, Will.
[SPEAKER_12]: I hope you guys are doing well today.
[SPEAKER_12]: So, Will, Avni, there's going to be moments in, I think,
[SPEAKER_12]: If we go back to what you do, which is about identity, you worked so long in the financial industry and sales, and now you're doing what you're doing now.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm so proud of you to have made that transition.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's very amazing.
[SPEAKER_12]: But there must have been moments where there was a sense of shakability.
[SPEAKER_12]: Or I suppose it was a more of a slow burn that you actually were doing the trainings while you were working in finance and sales.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so, you know, it wasn't just a kind of complete, you know, jump.
[SPEAKER_12]: But I suppose when you were first starting and you're beginning your practice, that there's elements of you've been in corporate for so long.
[SPEAKER_12]: now you're working for yourself.
[SPEAKER_12]: So, you know, I know it's quite personal and going back to the biographical, but I think it'd be just quite nice to hear a little bit about your stories about where was the moment where things became unshakable for you?
[SPEAKER_12]: Was there an event or was it gradual or was it a day?
[SPEAKER_12]: Were there just opportunities where being shakable versus being unshakable, there's that moment where it's like, no, I got this because I know who I am.
[SPEAKER_12]: I know who I actually am.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy to share.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm an open book, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can ask me anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here is basically what happened to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's probably not what you're thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I was in sales for a very long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had some good jobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had some jobs that I was not prepared for, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing wrong with the job.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't up to the task.
[SPEAKER_00]: But every one of them taught me something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, around about 2021, right, so after the big lockdown, we were getting back to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was very unhappy with the direction that my life was headed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was working for the bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was pretty well paid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a mortgage manager.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a team of about nine people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was looking at my life as, if I keep going this way, I'm going to have the success, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Financially, I'm OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to have a job that I like.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm not having the impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not having the fulfillment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember Tony Robbins saying once that success without fulfillment is the ultimate failure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that kept playing in my head as I was going to work every single day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in the car.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was sat in the car park before I was going into work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that thought played in my head for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So luckily, I've been into personal growth for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And guys, if you're in sales, you're also into personal growth because they are one to one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been reading, you know, Jim Rohn, Brian Tracy, Bob Proctor, who I consider my biggest mentor for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at that time, I decided, right, okay, I'm going to get really serious about who I'm being, about me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd heard on the fringes, like identity controls behavior.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read psychokinetics, but I never really got it until this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started deep diving into Neville Goddard, who was one of the best influencers on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was all about the idea that it's your internal self that
[SPEAKER_00]: that conforms to the outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, again, at the time, I was looking for shortcuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was looking for manifestation stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I think we all go through that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the underlying truth that stood out to me was that psychology, biology, as well as now this spiritual, more metaphysical stuff, all said the same thing, which is who you are on the inside determines the world that you experience on the outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really did a deep dive on this over the two years that were after it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by the time that 2024 came around and my company was doing redundancies, I was happy to step away because I knew that I could make it happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know how, I still don't know how, but I know that I'm gonna make it happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that my goals, because I can see them and I know the mechanism that I'm training my subconscious to look for the thing that I am focused on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that that influences my behavior.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the real thing that really got to me was understanding that my behavior is 97% unconscious.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost identical to yesterday.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that if I want to break that loop, it starts internally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you realize this, and when you realize that no circumstance has an inherent meaning, you lose your job, that's not good, it's not bad, it's just a circumstance.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can choose to have a good experience, great, an opportunity to level up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you can look at it as a bad circumstance, this is the end of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of those realities are right there, and it's only you that gets to choose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I suppose, just to answer your question fully, one other book that had a massive impact on me was Man's Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I talked about him before.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a Jew in the World War II camps, and he went through the very worst that humanity can go through.
[SPEAKER_00]: He lost all his family and friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had to bury them himself.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was worked almost to death.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he realized that in the worst circumstance possible, nothing outside of him had the ability to change his mind if he didn't, if he was conscious.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he wrote a brilliant book on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to answer your question, Kailash, once I truly understood that, that I am the operant power, that nothing outside of me gets a vote on what goes on within me, a lot of the fear that I had fell away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, that's not to say I don't experience nerves or I don't experience disappointment because I do, but I'm very good these days at catching it the moment I become aware of it and flipping it to exactly where I want to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that way, I never lose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Genuinely, I make a lesson or I make a victory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of those serve me.
[SPEAKER_00]: that lends itself well to massive amounts of self-confidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you layer in the work that I do with self-concept and subconscious identity, it compounds on each other like nothing else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now the world around me could burn down and I can look at it and say, I'll rebuild it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was not true of me three years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So does that answer your question, mate?
[SPEAKER_12]: That was absolutely amazing and I think it's just great to hear some of the biography of our speakers because you know these spaces in the startup circle are so inspiring and getting to hear a little bit from you guys I think is also refreshing.
[SPEAKER_12]: One video that you had done recently on the comparison trap was something I sent in my circles
[SPEAKER_12]: And it was just a great reframing of that shakability of envy.
[SPEAKER_12]: You call it the comparison trap, which is so much a better way of putting it, because I think when we talk about envy, people's backs get up, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: Because we all experience either being the source of it or the target of it, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: So I thought that that was amazing because that was a great example of how to be unshakable, that you have an opportunity for envy, and then you redirect that and realize, as you said, all the different tactics.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I really recommend guys going on Will's ex-account, scrolling down to that comparison post.
[SPEAKER_12]: And if that's something that you've experienced, it's only one minute long, but it was so rich that it's worth saying.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to ask one more question, Will.
[SPEAKER_12]: because I would love you either to make a video about this or if you could talk a little bit about it now.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I don't have an issue of envy because I'm actually quite confident in myself.
[SPEAKER_12]: What I'm facing consistently is being envied and it really shakes me to my core.
[SPEAKER_12]: and it's something that I think is happening now more and more as I get more authority in my field.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm going to be speaking at Oxford University this weekend and for me this is like a pinnacle of my research.
[SPEAKER_12]: to finally, 18 years ago, be rejected to then being invited to speak.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's kind of been like this full circle moment.
[SPEAKER_12]: But at the same time, what's been coming up in my week is when I'm in a class or when I'm in a space or when I'm just in other parts of other arenas of my life,
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm getting a lot of envy directed my way.
[SPEAKER_12]: And my analyst tells me that I have to learn to tolerate the envy and just do the thing anyway, which is fine.
[SPEAKER_12]: I can do that.
[SPEAKER_12]: But I just would love to have your concept and your understanding of when we actually start to reach some level of success and we become a target for envy, and people don't know our stories, don't know how hard we've worked to get to where we got to.
[SPEAKER_12]: They just see
[SPEAKER_12]: achievement, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: They see the picture, they see the tweet, they see the very well-put-together kind of moment, and then they project that comparison trap that they get into.
[SPEAKER_12]: But on the other side, there's a human being, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: We always talk about the person that is being envied, and we're trying to reassure the envier, but what about the person who is envied?
[SPEAKER_12]: Because they're just living life,
[SPEAKER_12]: But at the same time, it would be a complete lie not to say that I'm not shaken by it, because it's not a nice emotion to be around.
[SPEAKER_12]: And it was what I faced in my corporate career.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's what I faced in my academic career.
[SPEAKER_12]: And for me, it's probably one of the last frontiers for me to kind of, quote unquote, integrate.
[SPEAKER_12]: Because once I'm able to integrate being envied, because I think I've already handled the envying part,
[SPEAKER_12]: that that last piece, I feel like that would be an amazing moment in my 30s for me to be able to like tolerate and kind of alchemize envy as being a target of it.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I don't know what you think about that, Will.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's a great, that's a great topic, Avni.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we should make a note and maybe do a space on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you the quick version because I want to get to the hands as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here is my view on that, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Envy is a state of it's a lack of awareness, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because basically what envy is saying is that person has something that I don't have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I said in the video,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can always put yourself in the state, right, of celebrating that person, because what the brain is going to do, and just for anyone who didn't see the video, what the brain is going to do is it's going to look at that person and it's going to mirror them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to say, they're up here and I'm down here, therefore, I am not as good as them, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what's going to happen unconsciously.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why scrolling social media is so bad for you, for many reasons, but one of them is you're going to see a lot of things out there and your brain is going to interpret them as they have and I do not have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now think about this from a evolutionary perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: This used to teach us when we were more physical, who to follow, who had results, who had skills, who was worthy of following, because this person can teach me something I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm safe with them, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because ultimately it just comes back to safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, today, we step into this, why do they have it and I don't?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what the brain's gonna do is it's gonna start making up reasons, right, for that thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're lucky, they were born in the right place, it's not as easy for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: All this is doing is trying to justify to the brain that you are safe where you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're okay to stay there, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: When other people are envying you, and this will happen to all of us, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone in this room right now has something that somebody else wants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're young, you've got time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're older, you've got experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you're a male, if you're a woman, it doesn't really matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You all have something that other people want.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the envy is, it doesn't belong in you, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not in your control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I say to people, there's two domains that we live in.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the internal domain of which you are the sovereign.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're basically God within, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You have the ability to imagine anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's the external world, which is a game that we play, but we don't control.
[SPEAKER_00]: So other people will envy you, other people will love you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't control either of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal is to become unshakable, which means that I am not taken up by praise and I am not brought down by envy or disparagement.
[SPEAKER_00]: It means that no matter what anyone says about me, I know who I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I personally subscribe to the idea that we're all source, we're all consciousness, we're one consciousness in many forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not particularly relevant to this conversation, but what that does is it lets me see that your perspective is just as valid as mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, and I'll explain how this ties into envy in a moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said earlier in the space that the only thing we lack is awareness, and I truly mean that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I truly believe that what somebody is lacking is the awareness of
[SPEAKER_00]: You have your perspective and I have mine and they're both valid to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone is objectively correct in their subjective reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say somebody who's starting out in their career sees you as somebody speaking at Oxford, a seasoned professional in the industry, someone worthy of respect and accolades and all the great stuff that you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they, their unaware self is gonna say, that person is a threat to my current level.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I consider myself a success and that person is above me, now that person is, I am not a success in relation to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the beautiful thing about this is, rather than trying to change that person, internally, we can actually just see them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not good, they're not bad, they're just a limited perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not my position to try and change somebody outside of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a fool's game.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if I'm dependent on the external world being a certain way for me to be satisfied and fulfilled within, I'm at its mercy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've made it a false god.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that just means, guys, that you've given something the power to tell you who you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: My biggest strength and the thing that I try and teach people every single day is that you are the operant power.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing out there gets to say who you are within.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that means you have to let go of the need for other people to see you in a particular way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if your self-concept, if your sense of self is based on other people's approval, again, you're at their mercy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they don't approve of you and you need that, and they go away, you don't have self-worth anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: it was based on something fleeting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we know anything else about the world, it's that the world is constantly changing, that what is true today will not be true tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're seeing this now.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people who thought they were at the top of their game have got displaced by just the idea of AI, not necessarily the reality of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I would say to you, Kitash, just to give you some coaching, if you're open to it in this moment, is
[SPEAKER_00]: When you are standing on that stage and you are feeling the feelings of these people are envying me, maybe they're saying it, maybe they're not, it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: The feelings are yours, that is your domain.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have the opportunity to reframe it and say, I have the opportunity to inspire these people.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may look at me from their perspective and see me as a threat, but I choose to see myself as an inspiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: I choose to see myself as the bar these people can aspire to and get beyond.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jesus said this too, even greater things are you capable of than I.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the goal is, you're not gonna be universally loved, nobody is, and that's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, always gonna be unwanted and wanted situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are people who don't like me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't like that I talk about the Bible.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't like that I try and inspire people rather than hook them into a service that they don't need to forever, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people in the coaching space, and I'll just tell you this, that I have experienced personally,
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could take this to the medical realm as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not interested in curing people.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're interested in medicating them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to me, that just screams of scarcity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It screams of lack.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can reframe anything in that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So rather than seeing them as envious of you, you have the ability to interpret that as I'm inspiring them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm giving them a bar to aim for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wish them well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish that they reach that bar and supersede me and give me a new target.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like Goku and Vegeta, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Goku's always a little bit stronger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vegeta's like, that's the bar I need to clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how I would reframe it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Does that help?
[SPEAKER_12]: That was amazing.
[SPEAKER_12]: That was the missing piece, Will.
[SPEAKER_12]: And if this is just an indication of what it's like working with you full time.
[SPEAKER_12]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_12]: Like that, that was brilliant.
[SPEAKER_12]: So shifting from, you know, the anxiety of being envied because I'm very sensitive emotionally to that and attuned to it.
[SPEAKER_12]: and I think maybe overly attuned to it at the point where it's kind of like I can just sense in the transference, right, or even microexpressions, because it's so common.
[SPEAKER_12]: But now I think what it is is you've given me a reframe, Will, that I just feel already there's a liberatory potential now, frees up a lot more energy for me to just crack on.
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, just crack on.
[SPEAKER_12]: So thank you so much, Will.
[SPEAKER_12]: That was wonderful.
[SPEAKER_12]: And yeah, looking forward to hearing what everybody else has to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, I want to quickly, I think Netta had to jump out, so I do apologize if you're listening back Netta, but I thought that was really important and it actually is another demonstration, we've had two so far today, of how being unshakeable in the moment, right, because you could be on stage and you could have that thought of envy and your brain is focused on that and now it's going to produce more of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you can be in the mindset of I'm inspiring them and now your brain's focused on that and it's going to produce more of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyone listening, this is not simply an internal way of feeling better, although that's a nice side effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a way of training the brain what things mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when it looks to reality through the lens of what you give it the meaning of, now it will interpret and cause your action to be congruent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there's a world, if you feel people are gonna envy me, you're gonna hold yourself back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna do less work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna stop putting yourself out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not you particularly, but people in general.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's my issue, that I've held myself back because to be seen is to be in danger.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that, I can't afford to do that anymore, guys.
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_12]: I have to be able just to live in my excellence because that is literally what I'm here to do.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so you saying that kind of piece is, is just amazing.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think, I think, well, you know, as you said, in terms of the coaching sphere for yourself, you know, there is a threat where you actually, you factor in obsolescence within your service, i.e.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not here to have a client for 12 months, even unless they sign up for that, you know, you're here to kind of allow them the tools to basically individuate.
[SPEAKER_12]: And maybe that might be five sessions.
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe that might be 10.
[SPEAKER_12]: But by doing it, you're actually threatening other business models.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I can see in that sense how that can be in that particular regard, but you don't pay attention to it.
[SPEAKER_12]: This is the unshakability for you, Will, and I think that that piece for me is great.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think anybody else who's also reaching excellence and maybe in a place where they feel that envy, I think that what Will said, hopefully that will be helpful for other people here where I'm now going to just run the inspiration
[SPEAKER_12]: moment and I think that that's, because for me it's not on the stage, I don't really mind that, I'm really good at that bit.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's the networking after, it's the dinner parties and receptions afterwards, it's the Barbara Marx, it's the whatever, etc, etc.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I can kind of navigate that but I'm still, you know, human and I kind of get, I'm sensitive.
[SPEAKER_12]: But now I'm thinking, well, yeah, in those barb remarks over champagne or wine in these receptions and stuff, it's actually less so about their envy to me.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's more like, how can I shift the energy while that's happening internally for me to be an inspiration?
[SPEAKER_12]: That then means I can just slide over and be aerodynamic to the right people in the room.
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Katosh, this may be a really weird thing to be saying, but just since we're on the topic of envy and being envied, I always thought those who envy have too much free time and they should instead shift what they're doing to focus on themselves.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's why you're envious because you're not spending your time wisely.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then when you're being envied and you're noticing it, I think it's because you're scared yourself of your own achievements.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's something you can't believe you finally reached.
[SPEAKER_09]: And what you should do is look for a new goal so you can refocus yourself versus focusing on those envying you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because when you're doing that, you end up kind of stopping yourself or putting like a little glass ceiling on yourself.
[SPEAKER_12]: That is amazing, Avni.
[SPEAKER_12]: You guys are on fire today, so that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I need a new, now I've reached this particular form of excellence, now it's the next step.
[SPEAKER_12]: So wow, okay, this is perfect, guys.
[SPEAKER_12]: No more glass ceiling, let's be inspiring, find that next new horizon, and keep looking to the stars, that's brilliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's what I'm gonna add very quickly, just for anybody in the room, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a core tenet of being unshakable, not just envy, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just an external trigger or an external focus on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I'm speaking directly to envy from a coach's perspective, so Katosha, to answer your question and to give you something, because I always want to give people something practical, because knowing it does nothing, implementing it does everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gratitude and guilt, I would say, are the two sides of the coin of envy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guilt, which is what we feel, oftentimes when we're being envied, it triggers guilt, isolation, self-sabotage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, from a biological perspective, it's saying, I don't fit in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm shining a bit too bright.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I need to drop my light so I fit in and be accepted.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can lead to isolation if you are too far outside the pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the body and the brain hate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So gratitude is one thing I like to go to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get to be the inspiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so grateful for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, it's never about what's happening outside of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an opportunity to define your internal state, because that's all that's in your domain.
[SPEAKER_00]: People could come up to me and be like, hey, Will, you suck.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, cool, I appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing outside of me can take that away.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds ridiculous, but the brain only listens to the meaning you give it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other side though, so guilt will say, who am I to have this outcome?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's justifying it then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas gratitude says, I'm so happy and grateful I already have this outcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the difference between the two is the difference between I am and I am not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is how the brain works.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am successful and I'm so grateful to be here will train the brain that success is safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not, which is, I'm so guilty, I don't deserve this, you know, other people have worked harder than me, X, Y, Z, trains that I am not, it's not safe, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I would say to you, Katosh, the next time you're in a situation like this, practice that frame, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Practice the gratitude frame.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so happy and grateful that I get to be an inspiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: If people come up to you and they give you a Bob remark, okay, that just shows you their level of awareness.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't mean anything about you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not revealing anything to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're revealing themselves to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alex Mosey said the other day, there are two types of people in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: People that talk shit and people that build shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll never get the first from the second.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do want to go to the hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to check in with Netta.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you had to run for a work call.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know I went on a little bit trying to answer that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want to throw the mic to you specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I want to go to the rest of the hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Netta, over to you if you're free.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'll try to make it quick.
[SPEAKER_10]: How to stay unshakable one life.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so know your why.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've mentioned that before when you know your why and you know your North Star and you know the impact you want to make or
[SPEAKER_10]: impact you want to make for your users but also some people are doing a business with the money they can help out their family and have a better quality of life.
[SPEAKER_10]: Whatever that why is, that's going to help you keep going when things
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks shake up someone also brought up envy and how others will envy them when they succeed I will say that that is a reflection of their lack and I believe that was also brought up by will and Don't let that get to you people will always hate on others other people's success and Just don't let that get to you.
[SPEAKER_10]: You do your thing and
[SPEAKER_10]: Be proud of what your work and if other people choose to see that and support you That means they're meant to be in your life.
[SPEAKER_10]: And if they choose to hate on you Well, you have a great reason to slam the door on their face the third thing I wanted to say very very very earlier in the space the the notion of How to keep your customers happy was brought up.
[SPEAKER_10]: Am I correct?
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it was like I believe uh
[SPEAKER_10]: Stephen brought that up.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I used to work at Hootsuite, which is B2B as an escalation technical support representative.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that was really hard because the primary method of communication with our clients was over email.
[SPEAKER_10]: So you had to be very careful about how to use your phrasing.
[SPEAKER_10]: I would say how to keep your customers happiest to go above and beyond.
[SPEAKER_10]: And if they are
[SPEAKER_10]: Frustrated and they are taking the time to voice their frustrations instead of a customer like a company.
[SPEAKER_10]: Instead of going by the rules and their policies should really kind of.
[SPEAKER_10]: Break some of that some of that mold that they've created and.
[SPEAKER_10]: help the customer instead of being so methodical and buy the book.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that really frustrates a lot of clients and a lot of people, they just give up on the company and they leave when they see the company doesn't do anything.
[SPEAKER_10]: And before it gets ugly and it goes into social media and word of mouth starts going around like a forest fire, take action.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I love the points you brought up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I did complaints for a while while I was working at the bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd have to do call takeovers every now and again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things you learn in any sort of retail or any sort of customer support is that the people who take the time to voice their concerns are often your biggest learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to be your best customers if you solve their problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all they want is to feel safe and heard and have their problem solved.
[SPEAKER_00]: And oftentimes, they end up being, we talked about net promoter score, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We had Riley in here the other day.
[SPEAKER_00]: They often end up being your biggest promoters, I have noticed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, Avni, I'm gonna throw it over to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aubrey, if you wanna chime in with anything that's gone on as well, feel free.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then let's get to these hands, because we've got quite a few wonderful people to get through and about half an hour to do it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you just now mentioned our biggest supporters and our biggest supporters are everyone in this space right now because they're spending their time, their energy and their opinions and perspectives with us and something else they could share is the space.
[SPEAKER_09]: So to do that, you should touch the arrow up top, DM some friends, pop us in those group chats.
[SPEAKER_09]: Even touch that purple pill right hand corner.
[SPEAKER_09]: I know you see it because I see it too.
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks nice, bright and shiny.
[SPEAKER_09]: Give it a touch, a like, retweet, comment something that you found interesting that somebody said in this space that might have inspired you today or that you just really liked herring.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then let's quickly check in with Aubrey, our lovely co-host, our special guest co-host.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we'll go and jump over to Patricia and then Fabio.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, yes, you know, these are great conversations.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just wanted to kind of touch on, you know, we all tell ourselves stories, you know, when we don't, we don't have all the information about how other people are feeling about us, whether they're envious or, you know, hateful or whatever.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, that lack of information
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, we have to kind of rationalize in our own head and that makes us tell stories about stuff And you know, we should avoid that we should you know focus on ourselves and our own success and um Not assume we know what people are thinking, you know, because again at the end of the day Everybody's got their own story to tell and their own reasons for
[SPEAKER_08]: Feeling the way they do.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's that's kind of my my chance on Not letting envy or Being envious of other people get to you for sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't have to tell a story.
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't have to make assumptions We can just carry on with our life
[SPEAKER_09]: I like that, Aubrey.
[SPEAKER_09]: We should just carry on with our life, just like we should carry on with these hands.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm very curious there, Fabio, what helps you keep pushing through when you feel like giving up?
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Avni.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a great question.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it connects with something that I've been going through lately.
[SPEAKER_02]: and uh that i wanted to share and actually like this also connects with what uh netta was was speaking um and the title of the space that it has to do with like finding your why and um i've had a
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had a long period of soul searching in these past few years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was doing like, I was like running, I had like this shiny object syndrome, running after everything that seemed shiny.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, so I did a lot of things and nothing at the same time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But my,
[SPEAKER_02]: my background is in negotiation and conflict management.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I did a lot of mediation and I did a lot of like, uh, dialogue facilitation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, what I really liked, like what I loved about what I did before was like the amount of adrenaline that I would get, um, with like a conversation that,
[SPEAKER_02]: Conversations in the set of mediation, they have to be very intentional and purpose-driven.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time, anything can happen because emotions are really...
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: People have their emotions up their sleeves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything can happen at any time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so there is like this thrill of guiding those conversations and building knowledge together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just had this realization that, man, I missed this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I, over the weekend, I was like, wow, I really missed this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, I worked with this for like seven years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, yeah, I was just like, wow, I did not imagine that I missed this so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I decided that I want to go back to this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the craziest thing is, I always knew that I loved the thrill of these hard conversations or these constructive conversations.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always loved
[SPEAKER_02]: um creating sense out of chaos and um so i was always like i know that i i was true to my uh to my interests in a way i i hope i'm not getting like too uh confusing here um but so with this like i made a decision
[SPEAKER_02]: I did learn a lot in these past two years like I learned a lot like ghostwriting, paid ads, branding, personal brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: I learned a lot from like very great creators and I was able to offer services but I never felt like I was
[SPEAKER_02]: in my, in my element, you know, and my element has always been unshakable, which is this like connecting to people and, uh, like the thrill, the adrenaline of like building, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: building with people from conversations.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I, yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm being a little bit idealistic here, but like, I just want to say that there's something in our essence that isn't shakable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we are in doubt, just like, it helps to look at ourselves and our why, like what moves us.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're always going to have an answer for ourselves if we feel lost.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: I do have a question for you.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you mentioned that you were doing basically everything but not the thing you kind of really wanted to do.
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you now doing the thing you wanted to do?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I did a little bit of spaces, which I kind of felt like it was something similar to what I did before.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've been more intentional now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm working on doing this as a service for people and for companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for the follow-up question, Avni.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yes, now this is going to be my focus from now on.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, Avni, thank you for two great questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much for the opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to jump in real quick, hopefully with a third, and then we're going to go to the other hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want to just speak to one of the things you said there, Fabio, which was shiny object syndrome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we've lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you are still there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw the hand drop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shiny object syndrome and what Neto was saying and what you were saying about a why, these are correlated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, shiny object syndrome is where you know you need to be somewhere other than where you are, but it can be anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where, and we did values elicitation a few weeks ago, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If your value is freedom, then you have a North Star.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your value is, for example, if your value is just to get as rich as possible, there are many ways you can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if your value is freedom, then you only want to do it in ways that give you freedom.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to work 60, 70, 80 hours a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay and it also works in reverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are people like myself that don't do well with a lot of free time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need a project to work on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need something to do because I feel like life is meant to be lived but that's not everyone's case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now shiny object syndrome is and actually it's a defense mechanism for the brain and this is so interesting right because I spent a lot of time studying this to help people with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know that you have a comfort zone, or your brain, let's say, because this isn't a conscious thing, it knows that you operate well within a certain boundary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you may aspire to be very far away from that boundary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say you're earning $10,000 a year, right, just as a very, very low amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's enough to physically survive, but not much more than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your brain, if it learns that this is safe and that earning more for whatever reason is bad for you, let's say you don't want to out-earn your parents, you don't want to stand out, you don't want to have to pay extra taxes or whatever it is, it will keep you looking for new shiny objects to keep you where you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll do one mile in ten directions but at the end of the process you've actually gone nowhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you feel busy so consciously you are, you're busy, you're distracted, you are living apparently what you should be doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could be working 80 hours a week but if none of those hours are intentional and actually getting you towards your goal because your mind convinces you that you should be doing this and then oh my god that's the best way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a fear response that I am missing out on the fastest car going nowhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a fear response.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the brain loves this because you don't actually go anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a mental game.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the nervous system only really pipes up when there's danger.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you dabble in something, it might feel good for a little bit of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might get some dopamine, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The brain's like, ooh, new, shiny, like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never actually get to the point where you go through what Mosey calls the big sad, the valley of despair, which actually requires you to have an intrinsic motivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the brain is fine with this because, again, nothing has physically changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not changing the situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as soon as it becomes real, as soon as you book the first clients, the first delivery, as soon as you're on the hook for money, it's like, oh, this is dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else can I be doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you think about it, it's a distraction technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: So rather than going five miles in one direction, you went one mile and then turned back on yourself and walked another mile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you do that over and over again, and all of a sudden, you've walked 10 miles, but you've not gone anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is one of the things I see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I call it the fastest car going nowhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, do I want dropshipping?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I want get into crypto?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I want to do ghostwriting?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know what I want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any of them will work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why would I do one mile for one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I didn't know where I was going, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is why values are so important.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you value freedom, if you value having plenty, if you value having time with your family, it's going to cut off a lot of those things, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So shiny object syndrome is simply a lack of clarity, and it's a lack of embodiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a defense mechanism.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if anyone in the room, and by the way, guys, this is playing into becoming unshakable.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anyone in the room does suffer from shiny object syndrome, what I would consider you to do, what I would encourage you to do is this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write down why you wanna be successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write down why you want 10K a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once you've done that, go a couple of levels deeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will get to what you value.
[SPEAKER_00]: I value my time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I value my freedom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I value having nice things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I value the feeling of being in my perfect place doing what I love.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is the reason that I do what I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, I make a video every single day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have done about a year now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do group calls almost every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do spaces once a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason I do this is because I'm in my perfect place doing what I love, and I decided what that was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to be a ghostwriter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to be a software developer, because those are fast cars, but they're not going the way I want to go, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is where it becomes unshakeable.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter what the world is showing me, because this is the golden rule, it's as within, so without.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter what the as without is showing me, I don't get moved within.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone could come to me and say, Hey, well, look, you could do, you know, 10 X the money with this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if that thing doesn't line up with my values, I stand unshakable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say, no, that's not for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is for me.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, Will, I think it's time for me to shake you because we have hands to get to.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think you should go over to Justin real quick before we jump over to Patricia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very well, but hopefully that point landed with you guys because shiny object syndrome is huge, but it is a fear response.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so let's go to Justin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over to you, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, can we go to Patricia first and then I'll go because I'm checking out here on something.
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Justin fully could have said that he wanted to be a gentleman instead, but he just snitched on himself.
[SPEAKER_09]: So Patricia, over to you.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's all right.
[SPEAKER_11]: He can be a gentleman or not.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm good.
[SPEAKER_11]: So, um, okay, Katosh, I have a question for you, if you can take the mic.
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, is, is part of why being envied bothers you the fact that people don't know how much hard work went into?
[SPEAKER_11]: Because if, if that's what it is,
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I've had people look at what I do and say, Oh my God, you work like four hours a day and you get to do all these cool things.
[SPEAKER_11]: What they don't know is that I can work four hours a day at what I do because I've put in 15 freaking years.
[SPEAKER_11]: They don't want to talk about the nights that I was on a Chinese time zone.
[SPEAKER_11]: They don't want to talk about
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, the month that I was on an Australian time zone and had to function that way and still have a personal life here on the Eastern time zone.
[SPEAKER_11]: People think, oh my God, this is easy.
[SPEAKER_11]: And oh, I want, I want what she has.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's easy.
[SPEAKER_11]: Fine.
[SPEAKER_11]: Come switch with me.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's, let's do the 15 hour time flop and see if you like it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, because my body hates me for what I've done to it.
[SPEAKER_11]: for the last 15 years.
[SPEAKER_11]: So, but I'm thinking if that's what bothers you, if that's part of what bothers you, work more of that into your story or just lay it out somewhere.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, maybe on an about page, lay it all out there one time.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then when people are like, Oh, I wish I could do what you do.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it must be easy.
[SPEAKER_11]: It must be great.
[SPEAKER_11]: point them to it and go, why don't you read the story and tell me what you think, if you think it's so good.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then also, well, why have you got to call me out so hard the last few minutes?
[SPEAKER_11]: I was like screaming at my phone to please stop calling me out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will not, because I am here to help, not to just make people feel better.
[SPEAKER_11]: I know, I know.
[SPEAKER_11]: But I mean, I was like, oh my God, he's calling me out.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_09]: However, while I'm- Okay, Will, can you still have Patricia?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that X is playing its tricks again.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, Patricia, you may need to take a lap.
[SPEAKER_09]: Katosh, if you want to respond.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, Patricia, I think that that's amazing, because that means I'm able to control the narrative.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think one of the things that's great is I'm able to convey myself with a level of elegance and self assuredness.
[SPEAKER_12]: So there's a kind of aerodynamic way I'm able to tell who I am and how I am, just even in the timbre of my voice.
[SPEAKER_12]: However, as you said so eloquently, Patricia, it takes a lot of hard work to look this particularly quote-unquote slick
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think nobody really knows about that.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so for me, I think that that's possibly actually something I haven't even considered, but actually speaking a little bit more of controlling the narrative and saying who I actually am.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think it goes back to what Neda says in terms of stories, right?
[SPEAKER_12]: Because we get lost in stories either
[SPEAKER_12]: well, we get lost in the stories that we have for the world, but sometimes even the stories people have of ourselves, especially as Will has said, we haven't got that I am completely nailed down.
[SPEAKER_12]: So having a little bit of a biography or having a Substack article
[SPEAKER_12]: where I can just refer to certain things with regards to my research or my journey.
[SPEAKER_12]: As you said, hit it out once, knock it out of the park, keep it moving.
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that is a really, really smart way of also taking control of the narrative.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's been amazing.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_12]: Really wonderful suggestions today.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to steal what Katosh just said, let's hit it out once and keep it moving because we have many hands to keep it moving too.
[SPEAKER_09]: So Will, do you want to keep it short and sweet and then chuck the mic maybe back to Justin?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, let's do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to challenge a lot of people in the room right now by saying this, but it's important that you understand it because it's part of what makes people unshakeable.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hard work isn't justification for the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: The end is its own justification.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people will say, I suffered this much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I deserve it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you deserve it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The moment you claim it, you claim it within this is me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is who I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember the quote in the Bible to him that has more is given not to him that works hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you will work hard, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work many hours a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love what I do, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not work to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you will, because the action comes from, and this is a rant, but it's necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: The action comes from the state, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The state contains the means of its expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this means who you believe you are controls your habitual congruent behavior.
[SPEAKER_00]: It controls your thoughts, your feelings, your actions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Working hard does not unlock the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Persisting in the state unlocks the result.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you use the working hard as a badge of honor, you will always be fragile because if you don't work hard, and this is what I see from a lot of people is like, Oh, that's too easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't make that money that easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gotta be hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they hold themselves apart from success.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it can't be that easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't just write this much thing and get this much money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something must be wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a scam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Allow it to be as easy or hard as it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not your choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your only choice, your only area of influence is your internal states.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your actions are 95 to 97% habitual.
[SPEAKER_00]: The results are outside of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can control your inputs, but not your outputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: A high leverage input will outperform a hustled input, depending on the mindset, depending on the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please do work hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Action is necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Action's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But don't make the mistake of believing that hard work from a position of lack will get you anything other than more lack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is going to be an unhappy life that I have lived more than I would like to admit.
[SPEAKER_00]: My 20s were basically that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please do not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please learn from my mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is all as within, so without.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's throw it to Justin.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, this has been a very powerful space and I'm I'm I'm a lifelong student first and foremost.
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you Will and Abney and Aubrey for hosting this amazing space.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of great people here.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of great things have been said.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm reflecting on a couple points here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me pull up my notes so.
[SPEAKER_07]: In my 20s I was all about proving myself, which will just talked about it right?
[SPEAKER_07]: And then in my 30s I was all about.
[SPEAKER_07]: purpose and passion driven work.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then in my forties, now I'm all about being a good provider.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: But that all started with the commitment to self mastery, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to commit to self mastery.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now notice I didn't say a skill.
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't, I didn't say a skill first.
[SPEAKER_07]: I said, self mastery.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this requires a lot of personal development work, which is you're getting it right here.
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, live on these spaces from Will and Avni and everyone else.
[SPEAKER_07]: So nothing has meaning except the meaning you give it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't forget that point.
[SPEAKER_07]: Commit to self-mastery before skill mastery.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Netta mentioned the why.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the bigger the why, the easier the how.
[SPEAKER_07]: And don't just do the task.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do what's absolutely necessary and required.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now here's the difference between Ronin's and non Ronin's.
[SPEAKER_07]: Ronin's do whatever it takes ethically.
[SPEAKER_07]: They do whatever it takes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Period.
[SPEAKER_07]: Full stop.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you are a forced entrepreneur, you get out there and you sell.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because when you're in that position, you do whatever it takes.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the Ronin way.
[SPEAKER_07]: And always go above and beyond.
[SPEAKER_07]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, uh,
[SPEAKER_07]: because people will know and recognize when you're going above and beyond.
[SPEAKER_07]: When you're just doing what's required, they feel that.
[SPEAKER_07]: But when you do what's absolutely necessary, whatever it takes to go above and beyond, they will recognize that and they will appreciate that and respect that even more.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is why I signed contracts for years.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Fabio hit on the tough conversations.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not just with your friends, but with people who will hold you to a higher standard of excellence.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right, I know you're better than this will.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know you're better than this Netta.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know you're better than this Patricia Avni, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: We hold ourselves to a higher standard because the people who we surround ourselves with.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's two types of people.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's people who infect you.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's people who affect you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Make sure you're surrounding yourself accordingly.
[SPEAKER_07]: affect you positively, infect you negatively.
[SPEAKER_07]: And things take longer than 90 days minimum.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, I don't care what type of campaign you're doing.
[SPEAKER_07]: It takes longer than 90 days, 90 days at the minimum.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you commit to something, you got to stick to it for 90 days, period.
[SPEAKER_07]: Every day, not once a week.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not once a month.
[SPEAKER_07]: Every single day.
[SPEAKER_07]: And just remember you have an attitude of gratitude because that determines your altitude.
[SPEAKER_07]: And hard work works when it's in the, on the right things, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: You can work really hard.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like Fabio is working really hard.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: But what was it on the right things?
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's where you have to do an inventory and make sure that you're working on the right things personally, professionally.
[SPEAKER_07]: and claim it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like Will said, make sure you claim it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And persist in the state of being who you claim you are, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: I claim I'm the revenue Ronan.
[SPEAKER_07]: I am the revenue Ronan.
[SPEAKER_07]: That person shows up when Justin doesn't want to.
[SPEAKER_07]: That person delivers when Justin doesn't want to.
[SPEAKER_07]: Why?
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I've committed.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've committed.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm holding myself accountable to others.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not about me, it's about we.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, Justin, I'm gonna jump in there and steal the mic from you because yes, it is not about me, it is about we, and we have many hands.
[SPEAKER_09]: So let's jump over to Consciousness over there, or Conscious, and then right after we'll go to Teemu, please try and keep it short and sweet so we can then get to Prince.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a Prince in the space, Will.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna say hello to Will, Aubrey, Abney, hi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my gosh, what a great conversation and you triggered so many different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them was my emotional awareness and how mindfulness I had to be with my emotions and really pay attention when something was surfacing, just starting to come up, especially when things get messy and how you want to respond in a certain way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that was a really big one for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But not trusting my knowing was a really big one and what I valued.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there comes a point in our path where
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a real big initiation where you're finally trusting what you know all along.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not talking about intellectual certainty, I'm talking about inner certainty.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the moment your lived experience and your intuition and your core values, obviously they're aligning like you just said before, that coherent signal starts to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also feel that there's, I feel like the emotional awareness is the mastery, but trusting and knowing yourself is a sovereignty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I feel like there's many people that are mastering themselves, but they're really not, they still doubt their truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that never works.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just creates that internal friction or that energetic leakage that starts to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've experienced that myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I feel like there's that deeper place that needs to be tapped into before, and with that self-mastery, obviously, there's multitasking here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you have that self-knowing, something shifts.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's no longer that outsourcing of my, let's say, my intuition or my permission or my validation or my acceptance.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can maintain my peace without abandoning myself through the whole process, and I stop outsourcing by clarity, my standards, or even making other people comfortable.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not interested in that anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then clarity comes in, and my boundaries get firmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: My energy is really powerful, it's clear, there's that self-trust, that knowing within is so powerful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because when you're walking with that and you're standing in that, that creates momentum.
[SPEAKER_01]: That creates movement, relationships, life.
[SPEAKER_01]: It creates everything for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so I just wanted to share that, thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just brought up some really good stuff for me to take a look at again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's awesome to have you back in the space.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a very long time since we've spoken.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I wanted to say there, because like sovereignty and self-mastery in my eyes are one and the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can definitely see if we're looking from an external perspective how they would be different when we look at self-mastery as the act of disciplining your behavior.
[SPEAKER_00]: But instead, I look at it the act of disciplining your awareness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I think about sovereignty, and I say that you are sovereign, it's the name of my book, Sovereign Sleep, by the way, out soon, wherever books are sold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, point being, sovereignty is the internal authority, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You are sovereign of your internal domain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the goal of self-mastery is bringing your awareness back to that, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we can have that awareness when we're sitting down and meditating.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can have that awareness when we're doing our visualizations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can even have that awareness, and I heartily recommend you do this, as you go to sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that hypnagogic state that I talk about so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's the awareness in the moment where it counts, where you see the opposite, where you're like, I am a successful business owner, and you get a rejection.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the self-mastery part, is remembering the sovereignty in that moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, I am source and I get to choose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you have that awareness, that's the true level of self-mastery.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm really big on, and this is why I said to people, you don't need me, and you don't need anybody else.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a, and like all coaches, right, this goes for everybody, all mentors, all teachers, they're just an accelerant, a force, sorry, a time accelerant and a force multiplier.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have everything within you to be the person you have chosen to be no matter what.
[SPEAKER_00]: It requires discipline, focus, not on the behavior because the behavior is an expression of the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: The behavior is congruence with the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know like you know, and you mentioned knowing, right, which is the same thing as having, when you know that that's who you are, well, Justin knows he's a revenue ronin.
[SPEAKER_00]: He shows up because it's who he is.
[SPEAKER_00]: He doesn't have to force the behavior.
[SPEAKER_00]: The behavior might be difficult in the moment, but he knows he's going to get it done because it's congruent with the identity.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why identity is the highest leverage point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And self-mastery is the art of remembering that you're always in charge of the identity, no matter what.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the art of self-mastery to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really wanted to speak on that, because as you can tell, I'm a little bit passionate about it, because it's the ultimate.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no freedom like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No amount of money will get you this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like push-ups.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one can do your push-ups for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one can do your self-mastery for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can help, but I can't do it for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's throw it to, we've got Timo and Prince, Avni, who's up next?
[SPEAKER_09]: We're definitely going to go to Timo, but I do have to burst your bubble.
[SPEAKER_09]: There are actually electronic things now you can attach to your stomach to do those pushups for you.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you can work out.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can also get those sit-ups done as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can even get silicone implants, so you don't even have to work out.
[SPEAKER_09]: You could just get liposuction and put fake muscles into your body and you could be happy.
[SPEAKER_09]: So Timo, how do you feel about all of this?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's crap.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's for bots and biological LLMs.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's been good talking points throughout the space and a lot of speech about working hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think English is kind of a
[SPEAKER_03]: language that kind of stumbles here, because I would say most of the people here, when we're referring to working hard, we're doing something with in front of a monitor or something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Holding Zoom calls, coaching, writing digital e-books, building marketing campaigns, whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: But working hard, guys, come on.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you go to dig into a bedrock, chop that into pieces of granite and build a house from that, that is working hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would call it strategic, high level, high strategic, high level intensity work or something like that because
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: You are just working on something that is intensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people have the mental capacity to do it for a longer time, and it's practicable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, brain is kind of a muscle anyway, so it is not, but you can train it like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it can endure and get better endurance throughout when you are
[SPEAKER_03]: gradually increasing your work intensity levels.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's not working hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of us are not working hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then, for when things get messy, I think it's, again, good old poker reference, you cannot get upset
[SPEAKER_03]: things you don't have power over.
[SPEAKER_03]: The business life is a lot like
[SPEAKER_03]: playing poker, you do have to play the cards that you're dealt with, and you do have to play them as well as possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if the variance hits you cold, you just got to kind of take the L and move onwards.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if you emotionally get attached to results while you are still on your way,
[SPEAKER_03]: it is just destructive for the whatever effort you're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you do have to understand when you hop into things like building a business or playing poker or whatever you're doing that has a lot of data points that you cannot have power over.
[SPEAKER_03]: you're going to get served cold at some point.
[SPEAKER_03]: And being prepared for that is a good way to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when it comes to making money, a lot of things have been said on that topic, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm currently reading or listening through Speedrunning, a book called 48 Hour Startup by Noah Kagan.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's the name.
[SPEAKER_03]: In English, there's a great
[SPEAKER_03]: quote on starting a business.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you're starting a business over a weekend, you should just get one dollar out of someone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone that believes at least worth of one dollar what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And with that proof point, go onwards.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you cannot even get a dollar out of your idea, just trash it and move along because
[SPEAKER_03]: It's probably not worth it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, I'll land my plan here because the time is ticking.
[SPEAKER_09]: I feel like I'm going to try and get a dollar real quick from Prince, since he seems like a very rich man, and I'm going to his hand.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, Prince, can I get a dollar?
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure, you can get a dollar.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I think I've been handing out quite a bit of dollars as of late, but I'd love to get a dollar back.
[SPEAKER_04]: But no, this is a great space, Timo.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was very...
[SPEAKER_04]: Very well expressed.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys are fabulous at articulation and at living.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, thanks for having me on your space.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pleasure to be in the group with you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you know, the topic of, you know, just learning what to dance with and not dance with.
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, how to stay unshakable when life and business gets messy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like Will was saying, the importance of figuring out what your full purpose is, and I probably should go back and listen to it, but it's as opposed to some of the work that you've been putting a lot of emphasis on and making an impact.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for me, it's been, you know, just being myself, but at the same time also,
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, you know, it's been a lot of hard work.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been putting a lot of hard work in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but and for the folks that have seen that, um, you know, I, uh, certainly appreciate it, but it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a difficult experience, because you just kind of don't realize how much work that goes into it, how much multitasking that's required, how much a variety of skills that has to be involved.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the philanthropy has really been there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's not a glamorous experience.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a lot of glamorous work.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a lot of you get punched in the stomach quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: and, you know, want to make sure that we are all like Will is doing, you know, as a core expert.
[SPEAKER_04]: in, you know, leveling up our mindsets.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I'm a huge fan of Neville Gardner as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure he knows it like the back of his hand.
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of have a whole disheveled feel to me, but I am a very, I'd say a smart person for the most part, but there's still so much things for me to work on.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, just got to come in with humility, like Justin was saying.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, I'd like to, you know, certainly be, I don't even want to say the word, but you know, I certainly want to be appreciated for the work I've done.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I really just put a lot of hard work in and it takes somebody who's, I should be in those, those big meetings to a certain extent, but it is, so it is a little bit of a interesting experience.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's not, it's not as, I'm not formally involved in that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But for the people, I get the shout outs indirectly a lot of times, which I appreciate for the people.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I do have a quick, I do have a small, just quickly say it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do have a quick little charity if you guys want to leave a dollar or something, just to validate it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not usually one to ask, to be quite honest.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm not really someone who's a marketer.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm sure Will has a lot of great tips on that, which I'm looking to learn from.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not somebody who's really known to do that because of my experience of like being recovering, I would just say recovering codependent.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I'm a huge, I vibe with Justin's work as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm hoping you guys vibe with my support and hard work.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of, I guess what's the underlying theme there as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it's a challenging thing to kind of navigate through, but like Dr. Heath says, I'm sure you guys know him as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's been a huge mentor for me as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: He says, you know, you gotta,
[SPEAKER_04]: Communicate congregate with the people so this has been extremely fabulous and I appreciate you guys and I'll just leave it at that, you know, for now, you know, put a lot of hard work in and I'm always updating stuff I'm, you know, waking up at two o'clock in the morning just trying to make sure things are going well while we're making some improvements because the echo chambers, unfortunately, you know, that's something I'm concerned about but, you know, that's what we have guys like well and people to.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just a tuning fork and for guys like Will to continue and people like that to take it to the next level as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Prince, you are definitely more than a tuning fork, and you said you don't want to say it, but I want you to really right now say it in the space that I should be appreciated for my hard work, because that is something everyone deserves when they put effort into it.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you could say that real quick before we jump over to Will, and I know he's going to tell me off for doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to tell you off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to ask you to go a level beyond that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait, what?
[SPEAKER_09]: Really?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not I deserve to be appreciated for my hard work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's I am appreciated full stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not contingent on anything outside of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a fan of Neville Prince, this is probably going to land with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Assume the end state.
[SPEAKER_00]: The feeling of the wish fulfilled.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I guess there's, there's still a little bit of provision seeking surprisingly so there's a lot of things I have to work on internally, or just be I am, even though I've done a lot of heavy lifting or in the hard work so I am appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that good, or is that just a little shaky?
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't need to ask me.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was great.
[SPEAKER_09]: That is perfect.
[SPEAKER_09]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guys, I am appreciated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guys in the space, can I get a round of hands for Prince to show him how appreciated he is?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you guys want to leave us something, that'd certainly be appreciated.
[SPEAKER_04]: But hey, it's not an obligation, of course.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pleasure to be on the space with you guys this afternoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for being here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guys, we are going to have to wrap up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So unfortunately, we can't go for any more hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Avni has got additional co-hosting duties to do at 7pm UK, so 20 minutes from now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I understand it, she needs to have some food.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go ahead and begin wrapping up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anyone has any last words, drop them in the chat and I'll read them out for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But first things first, let's go to our wonderful guest co-host Aubrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been fantastic to meet you and have you here in our space.
[SPEAKER_00]: What has been your biggest takeaway?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, thank you so much, Will.
[SPEAKER_08]: This has been a really great space.
[SPEAKER_08]: My biggest takeaway is just the I am.
[SPEAKER_08]: The I am grateful.
[SPEAKER_08]: I am what I say I am.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: just really moving forward, I'm going to apply that and really look for the silver linings and the lessons that come with the messes.
[SPEAKER_08]: And yeah, I'm looking forward and definitely have a new way of looking at the world after this discussion for sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing and it really is all about that I am the brain only understands I am or I am not so when we say I will be we're saying I am not now and that keeps us stuck for years and decades sometimes we have to grab the X the result we want.
[SPEAKER_00]: from the future and bring it into the now moment because that's all that exists to your subconscious mind and your subconscious mind is what controls what you do so keep it in the future and you keep you remain free of the result as neville would say so bring it into the now and you've all heard this from many people but hear it from me you are that which you choose to be and your refusal to believe it is the only reason you don't see it
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great quote.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that from Neville.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that said, let's throw it over to Avni.
[SPEAKER_00]: What has been your biggest takeaway today, Avni?
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, there have been so many takeaways.
[SPEAKER_09]: But the one thing I really enjoyed was what Justin said earlier, where there are people that will infect you, and there are people that will affect you.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I thought that was really intriguing.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we could probably do a whole space about that topic, about infections and affections of people and the crowd you hang around with.
[SPEAKER_09]: But
[SPEAKER_09]: Sadly, we can't do that today, even though I could probably tempt you all to do it in a moment.
[SPEAKER_09]: But Will is right.
[SPEAKER_09]: I do have to eat some food.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not sure how he knew I was hungry over here.
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you to all the listeners for tuning in.
[SPEAKER_09]: You encourage all these speakers to come up and grace us with their presence and their lovely voice.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, speakers, for just chatting away this entire time and being so interactive.
[SPEAKER_09]: I do love it when you get inspired and passionate and motivated to share your views and opinions.
[SPEAKER_09]: Aubrey, thank you for being a special guest co-host.
[SPEAKER_09]: I gotta somehow tempt you to talk more.
[SPEAKER_09]: I feel like she's always so quiet and polite over there.
[SPEAKER_09]: And Will, I think you have to do the thing where you, you know, you end the space and press a button and we all disappear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get right to that in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are some wonderful messages and final words from our lovely audience members that I want to read out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from Justin, final word and biggest takeaway, don't prove it to others, prove it to yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Damn right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Commit to self mastery and everything positive stems from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is the revenue Ronan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to Prince, I would say any questions about marketing, I direct them to my good friend, Justin.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is my coach when it comes to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I point you in his direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the media he said how does one go from being busy to productive define your values know why you want what you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Claim the identity of already having it so the subconscious mind has instruction and then take action from that state not forced action aligned action and consciousness mentioned earlier on intuition that is in a tuition learning from within.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you occupy the state, the subconscious mind will make it congruent through your thoughts, feelings, actions, and results.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll seem like nudges.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll seem like intuition.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is subconscious congruence.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how you go from being busy to productive.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a few others in there, but I think those were the only closing thoughts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me give you mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to say, first of all, a massive thank you to everyone that's come up and shared during the space.
[SPEAKER_00]: To Fabio, to Katosh, to Justin, to our good friend, Von Jackson, we didn't get the chance to have up on the stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Timo.
[SPEAKER_00]: consciousness, and of course, our wonderful co-host Aubrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was lovely to have you here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Avni, as always, another immaculate job of co-hosting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for sharing your time with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me, guys, let's talk about what it means to be unshakeable very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It means that you are the operant power, that nothing outside of you gets to change who you are within.
[SPEAKER_00]: It means that you can be in the best of it or the worst of it and remain unshakable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it means that nothing outside of you has an inherent meaning other than the meaning you give it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is your power, that is your superpower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have the opportunity, if you're aware, to say, this has happened, good, what can I learn from it?
[SPEAKER_00]: You also have the ability to catastrophize.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of those will help you, one of those will not, and it is always your choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what it means to live unshakable, to be completely unaffected by the world out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't mean you don't get angry, doesn't mean you don't get upset, but it means you interpret that as you want to, because that is the power no one can take away from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were going to talk about the long-term game, but we got a little sidetracked, so I did have one final note that
[SPEAKER_00]: Playing the long-term game is for those who really know that their internal vision, what you can see for you, is your guiding star, not what you can see out there in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: The world can only show you what's already been, but you're the one who gets to define what's on the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you identify with it as already done within, your subconscious will get to work and make it happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So trust yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Know that you are the sovereign internally and that nothing outside of you has power to change that as long as you keep your awareness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So practice that daily self-mastery, my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the biggest ROI activity you can possibly do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that said, thank you for spending time with us today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep the vision, keep your identity front and center, keep your eyes on who you're becoming, remember where you came from, and that is how you stay unshakeable.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is how you play the internal game.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's it for this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be back same time next week, 5 p.m. UK, looking forward to seeing you all there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna be another fun one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So until then, my friends, stay heroic, and we will see you next week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a great evening.
